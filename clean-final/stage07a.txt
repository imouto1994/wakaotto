...3:30 in the afternoon...
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Don't look away from me."
Chihiro: "...We can still talk like this."
Yusaku: "Yeah, yeah."
He replies while munching.
It's not fully prepared, but it's tasty.
She's not looking at me, just staring down.
She's been in the same pose since she arrived.
Despite rushing over here, she's not very engaging.
Did I upset you?
Perhaps it was when I forcefully checked inside your bag.
But it was for the best.
She was carrying an anti-crime alarm.
And I found something else at the same time, food packed in a tupperware container.
The smell is appetizing when I bring it close.
Come to think of it, I skipped lunch.
So, I helped myself without asking.
Yusaku: "Was this for your husband to eat?"
Chihiro: "...Not necessarily."
Yusaku: "It's seasoned with garlic, so it must be."
Chihiro: "...When will my husband be back?"
Yusaku: "He's going straight home from his outing today."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "That's probably best for you, too. It would be difficult to explain if you had to face him. You certainly can't tell him the truth...right?"
Chihiro: "...Either way, I can't keep this visit a secret."
Yusaku: "Just use this as an excuse."
I roughly pushed the tupperware away.
Yusaku: "You came to bring me something. That's all the explanation needed."
Chihiro: "...Use something I've never done before as an excuse?"
Yusaku: "Then think of something on your own. Compared to before, you've become good at lying, right?"
Chihiro: "...!"
Yusaku: "Well, then..."
I let out a belch on purpose
I then conspicuously take out my mobile
Yusaku: "Burp."
Chihiro: "...Ugh."
Yusaku: "Excuse me."
Chihiro: "..."
Chihiro looks clearly disgusted.
The smell of garlic is lingering.
Even I find it too strong.
I hold my breath.
I then put my hand in my chest pocket.
I take out my mobile in a conspicuous manner.
Yusaku: "How many pictures do you want?"
Chihiro: "I... I don't need any pictures."
Yusaku: "You rushed over here because you wanted them, right?"
Chihiro: "No, that's not it."
Yusaku: "Then why did you come here?"
Chihiro: "...How did you know I was molested?"
Yusaku: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "So, how could you, who weren't at the scene, take pictures?"
Yusaku: "Because I was there."
Chihiro: "!?"
Yusaku: "Your cute mouth is hanging open."
Chihiro: "You... were there? Where?"
Yusaku: "In the next train car."
Chihiro: "...I finally understand the situation."
Yusaku: "Well, that's good."
Chihiro: "So those people were... your accomplices."
Yusaku: "Don't say something that sounds so bad."
Chihiro: "But it's the only explanation that makes sense."
Yusaku: "I just happened to be on the same train."
Chihiro: "No...way."
Yusaku: "Misconceptions can be harmful to your health."
Chihiro: "It's impossible for so many coincidences to occur."
Yusaku: "Were there any other coincidences besides me?"
Chihiro: "So many people... simultaneously molesting me, swarming around me as if it was planned..."
Yusaku: "That's because you're..."
Too beautiful?
Too ugly?
Yusaku: "Too beautiful, right?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Seems like you're convinced now."
Chihiro: "...Please don't joke around."
Yusaku: "I was being serious."
Chihiro: "You called me ugly before."
Yusaku: "Everyone has their own taste in women. It's not like I was the one who molested you."
Chihiro: "But even you, Chief... once..."
Yusaku: "That was because I couldn't see your face at the time."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Are you convinced now?"
Yusaku: "Too ugly, right?"
Chihiro: "Do... do ugly people get molested by many people?"
Yusaku: "Maybe everyone was just curious?"
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "Seems like you're convinced now."
Chihiro: "...I'm not."
Yusaku: "So you're saying you're not ugly?"
Chihiro: "No, it's not just about that..."
Yusaku: "It's about me being on the same train?"
Chihiro: "It's not something I can believe with just the word 'coincidence.'"
Yusaku: "You're a persistent woman."
Chihiro: "Were you lying in wait for me somewhere?"
Yusaku: "How do you explain coincidences?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Tell me."
Chihiro: "...Never mind."
Yusaku: "Giving up so easily?"
Chihiro: "Because you're not going to give me an honest answer anyway."
Yusaku: "If you want to think that way, be my guest."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Well, let's get to the main point now that we've had our disagreement."
I slouched on the sofa.
One hand in my pocket, my attitude as arrogant as it gets.
Yusaku: "What do you want me to do with these photos?"
Chihiro: "Even if I answer, it's pointless. It won't go the way I want it to."
Yusaku: "I just want to know your intentions."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Should I send them to your husband and his parents along with the guy who came to your room?"
Chihiro: "No, don't."
Yusaku: "Then what should I do?"
Chihiro: "Please delete the images on your phone."
Yusaku: "Which images?"
Chihiro: "..."
The ones I showed her were of her being molested.
She involuntarily turned her face away from the disgusting sight of herself.
Nice.
That gesture.
It sends shivers down my spine.
Yusaku: "Look at it properly."
Chihiro: "I... I don't want to look."
Yusaku: "You can't choose if you don't look."
Chihiro: "P-please... delete both..."
Yusaku: "Only one of them."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "Choose."
Chihiro: "The... the one of me being molested..."
Yusaku: "And the price for this?"
Chihiro: "...Huh?"
Yusaku: "The price for me to delete this image."
Chihiro: "Are you... asking me to buy it..."
Yusaku: "Don't say something so stupid."
I'm laughing.
I'm fed up with such cheap drama-like lines.
Yusaku: "I'm asking what you're going to give me in return."
Chihiro: "...I don't understand what you're saying."
She knows full well what I mean
Don't play the victim, ugly
Yusaku: "You know full well what I mean."
Chihiro: "I... I don't understand."
Yusaku: "Don't play the victim, ugly."
Chihiro: "U... ugly..."
Yusaku: "What would make me happy?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "You just have to fulfill what I desire."
Chihiro: "But... I..."
Yusaku: "...It seems like you want me to send the photos."
Chihiro: "N... no."
Yusaku: "Simply shaking your head won't end this conversation."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "What are you going to do? Come on, come on."
Chihiro: "I... I'll make lunch for you."
Yusaku: "Oh really..."
A step forward.
Good girl.
Get in deeper.
Choose the path that leads to the abyss.
Yusaku: "...Why did you think of that?"
Chihiro: "I... I couldn't think of anything else."
Yusaku: "Well, sure, that's one form of compensation, I guess."
Chihiro: "I-Is one not enough?"
Yusaku: "I want something more intense..."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Something that would make me want to delete the data."
Rustling, rustling...
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "What's wrong?"
Chihiro: "Please... stop."
Yusaku: "Stop what?"
Chihiro: "..."
You know.
You're concerned about the hand I've stuck in my pocket, aren't you?
It's been rustling for a while now.
It obviously looks like I'm fiddling with my dick.
Bingo.
I'm actually jerking off while looking at you.
It's a shame you're not in a skirt.
But underneath those jeans is probably a bare pussy.
That alone makes my excitement drastically different.
It was worth refraining from masturbation.
Even though it was only for three days.
Yusaku: "Let's continue the conversation."
Chihiro: "I'm... I'm going home now."
Yusaku: "I can't believe you can say that."
Chihiro: "What... What do you want me to do?"
Yusaku: "There's so much, it's hard to choose."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "First, I want to smell your armpits."
Chihiro: "No... No..."
Yusaku: "And having you spread your legs again would be nice."
Chihiro: "Stop... Stop it..."
Yusaku: "But those are just appetizers."
I put on my game face.
Staring down the woman.
Yusaku: "The main dish is... sex with your husband."
Chihiro: "What!?"
Yusaku: "I want to see it."
Chihiro: "What... What do you mean?"
Yusaku: "I want to see you having sex with your husband."
Chihiro: "Enough is enough!!"
Chihiro tries to stand up.
I roughly push her back down.
Purposefully grabbing her breast in the process.
*Squeeze*...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
She raises her hand in response.
Hey now.
You planning to slap me again?
*Squeeze*... *squeeze*...
Chihiro: "It... hurts..."
Yusaku: "Violence is not acceptable, ma'am."
I grab her wrist just before she can slap me.
And I raise her arm above her head.
Her armpit is wide open.
This pose is more lewd than I thought.
Chihiro: "Please... let me go."
Yusaku: "Don't raise your voice."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "It won't do either of us any good if someone comes, right?"
Chihiro: "If... If it's come to this..."
Yusaku: "Are you okay with doing something that would hurt your husband?"
*Rub*...
Chihiro: "It... It hurts..."
Yusaku: "All your previous endurance will be for nothing."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Consider the consequences of your actions..."
*Rub*...
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Think it through well."
Chihiro: "..."
Her resistance seems to weaken slightly.
My words act as a relaxant for her.
As it seeps into her body, the opportunity for me to take advantage expands.
Yusaku: "You seem to be nicely heated."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I bring my nose close to her armpit.
Purposefully sniffing like a dog.
It doesn't smell sweaty.
She used deodorant properly.
But I don't mind.
What matters is her facial expression.
The face twisted in pain and embarrassment, that's what I'm after.
Yusaku: "I'll be visiting your place again tonight."
Chihiro: "Please... no more... I beg you..."
Yusaku: "..."
Unnoticed by Chihiro, I slowly unzip.
Yusaku: "Think about what you're going to do. Will you endure a moment of embarrassment, or carry a lifetime of pain...?"
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "A smart woman like you should know which to choose."
Chihiro: "Please... don't ask the impossible."
Yusaku: "It's not impossible."
*Pop*...
Yusaku: "You can do it."
*Throb*... *throb*...
Yusaku: "With just that, you can regain your happiness."
Chihiro: "Just that... what do you mean by..."
!?
Did you finally notice?
Your second encounter with my penis.
This time it's erect.
Even just the tip, it's quite imposing, right?
Chihiro, taken aback by the outrageous act.
But no matter how surprised she is, it's too late.
Madam...
This is my first ejaculation aimed at you.
Accept it fully.
In that sweaty armpit of yours.
*Splurt*...
Yusaku: "Huh... ah..."
*Splurt*... *splurt*... *splurt*...
Chihiro: "Kyaa!!"
*Splurt*... *splurt*... *splurt*...
Chihiro: "No... disgusting... stop... let go... idiot...!"
