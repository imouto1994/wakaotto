Shota: "...uh..."
Chihiro: "Mm... Mm..."
Shota: "*pant*... *pant*..."
Chihiro: "You don't have to hold back, Shota-chan."
Shota: "But, but, Chihiro, you still haven't..."
Chihiro: "I secretly came earlier."
Shota: "... Is, is that so?"
Chihiro: "..."
That was actually a lie.
I've hardly been able to reach climax lately.
Even so, I'm satisfied.
Just having him inside me makes me happy.
Because I love Shota-chan so much.
Even when he's tired, he loves me with all his might.
He's a little timid, but he's a very kind person.
I'm genuinely glad that I married him.
*nup*... *nup*... *nup*...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Shota: "*pant*... *pant*... I'm... I'm about to..."
Chihiro: "I... feel good... I'm feeling it... ahn... ah... ah..."
Shota: "Ah... I'm coming... I'm coming..."
Let him finish inside me.
The words came up to my throat.
My period is due tomorrow.
I'm sure it's safe.
But...
Shota-chan doesn't want a child yet.
And I don't want to bother him even if there's a slight chance.
*pyu*.
