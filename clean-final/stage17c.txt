Yusaku: "...This way."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
She crawls on all fours until she passes through the door.
From there, he lets Chihiro lead the way.
He makes her move stealthily down the hallway.
And just before the rocky area.
Just as they reach the place where they can divert to the side path.
He pokes Chihiro's back.
At the same time, he cruelly steps on the hem of her yukata.
Chihiro: "Kyaa..."
Chihiro's naked body is exposed with a slip.
The discarded yukata sticks to the ground sadly.
He steps over it without a care.
Chihiro: "My... my yukata..."
Yusaku: "It's an open-air bath, so being naked is normal, right?"
Chihiro: "At least... at least give me a bath towel..."
Yusaku: "Just walk."
Chihiro: "Where... where are you telling me to walk...?"
Yusaku: "In the shadows of the rocks ahead."
They navigate the narrow spaces, right and left.
With every few steps, she looks back.
She asks him for the next direction to proceed.
Her full breasts sway behind her.
Her peach-colored, plump buttocks glisten.
Eventually, the tight space opens up all at once.
They come out to the back of the rocks surrounding the open-air bath.
Yusaku: "...Here."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Chihiro's eyes widen.
Her legs, which were closed, weaken.
She seems about to collapse.
Chihiro: "What are we... doing in such a place?"
Yusaku: "...Stop."
He interrupts her mid-sentence.
He urges Chihiro to listen carefully.
The distance to the autumn moon is about 10 meters.
Why he chose this place.
She'll probably realize in less than a minute.
Shota: "Phew..."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Shota: "...Chihiro's late."
Chihiro: "Sho... Shota-chan..."
Barely audible amidst the sounds of insects.
A voice so quiet that you wouldn't notice unless you held your breath.
But it definitely vibrates Chihiro's eardrums.
Her spine chills even more than before.
Yusaku: "Did you hear that?"
Chihiro: "...I heard... it."
Yusaku: "So that means?"
Chihiro: "Our voices... will be heard too."
Yusaku: "If we were talking normally, yes."
*Squish*...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "Let's test how much they can hear."
Chihiro: "You're... doing that again..."
Yusaku: "You're used to this thrilling situation, aren't you?"
Chihiro: "I'm... I'm not used to it."
Yusaku: "Didn't you give him a blowjob right next to him?"
Chihiro: "That... That was different."
Yusaku: "How so?"
Chihiro: "I can't... I can't deceive like I did in the kitchen."
Yusaku: "The distance this time is much larger."
Chihiro: "If my voice is heard, he'll come over here."
Yusaku: "...Indeed."
The sounds of lust were getting louder.
Chihiro: "No, stop..."
Yusaku: "But you like this thrill, don't you?"
Chihiro: "I don't like it at all."
Yusaku: "Despite that, your pussy is dripping."
*Rub*...
Chihiro: "Ah... stop..."
Yusaku: "It's just like when you were giving me a blowjob in the kitchen."
*Squelch*...
Chihiro: "Ah... ah... stop..."
Yusaku: "You love this, don't you?"
Chihiro: "Your voice is too loud, Section Chief..."
Yusaku: "Since you were on all fours, your pussy has been soaking wet."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Am I wrong?"
*Squelch*...
Chihiro: "Your finger inside... it's... unpleasant..."
Yusaku: "If you don't answer, I'm going to stir it around."
Chihiro: "Please, no more..."
Yusaku: "Answer first."
Chihiro: "...I was wet..."
Yusaku: "Where?"
Chihiro: "My... pussy..."
Yusaku: "Say it to your husband, not me."
Chihiro: "Why are you so cruel..."
Yusaku: "...Say it."
*Squelch*...
Chihiro: "I'll... I'll say it..."
Chihiro: "Shota, my... pussy... was wet..."
Yusaku: "Tell him the reason too."
Chihiro: "The reason is..."
Yusaku: "Be honest."
*Squelch*...
Chihiro: "Because I was on all fours in the hallway."
Yusaku: "Not just any all fours."
*Squelch*...
Chihiro: "No... he'll hear the sound..."
Yusaku: "What were you exposing at that time?"
Chihiro: "My... my pussy was completely exposed from behind..."
Yusaku: "Is that the only reason you were wet?"
Chihiro: "That's not the only reason."
Yusaku: "Confess everything."
Chihiro: "I didn't know when someone would come out... I might have been seen..."
Yusaku: "...That's right."
*Squelch*...
Chihiro: "Ah... ah..."
Yusaku: "What happens when you think about that?"
Chihiro: "My heart pounds so much I feel like I could die."
Yusaku: "You love being seen by people, don't you?"
Chihiro: "I hate it."
Yusaku: "You're lying."
*Squelch*...
Chihiro: "Ah...!"
Yusaku: "You really want to belong to everyone, don't you?"
Chihiro: "No... Only Shota..."
Yusaku: "If you love him that much, then look at him properly."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Who is he?"
Chihiro: "Sho... Shota."
Yusaku: "And what is Shota to you?"
Chihiro: "He... he's my precious husband."
Yusaku: "That's wrong."
*Squelch*...
Chihiro: "It... hurts..."
Yusaku: "He's just a dumb man who knows nothing."
Chihiro: "Please don't call him stupid."
Yusaku: "But it's the complete truth, isn't it?"
*Squelch*...
Chihiro: "Ah... sob..."
Yusaku: "Shota, being the serious guy he is, would never dream that his wife would be exposing herself in the hallway."
Chihiro: "If he found out, it would be the opposite of helpful..."
Yusaku: "He doesn't know you're going braless and pantyless since this morning, or that you're being touched like this."
Chihiro: "But I have no choice but to keep it a secret..."
Yusaku: "Even so, he's patiently waiting for you to come back. Hoping desperately that no other guests come, because he doesn't want to see his precious wife naked."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "What do you think of such a Shota?"
Chihiro: "It's... pitiful."
Yusaku: "...Yeah, it is."
Chihiro: "Because of me, Shota..."
Yusaku: "Is being belittled by an insensitive fool."
Chihiro: "But I can't do anything about it..."
Yusaku: "You can."
Chihiro: "It's... impossible."
Yusaku: "Just give him a little hint."
Chihiro: "Eh?"
Chihiro's body trembled.
Her wet flesh tightened.
Chihiro: "Wh... what do you mean by hint?"
Yusaku: "The real you."
Chihiro: "The real me...?"
Yusaku: "..."
I remained silent.
But what I was suggesting was easy to imagine.
I was pushing her right to the edge, without leaving a single hair behind.
Chihiro: "No... I can't."
Yusaku: "Why not?"
Chihiro: "I... I don't want him to know about that..."
Yusaku: "You said it's pitiful for him to be left out, right?"
Chihiro: "If he knew, wouldn't it be even more pitiful?"
Chihiro's voice was desperate.
Tears welled up in the corners of her eyes.
Her white body trembled slightly.
Chihiro: "Please... let me go back to the room."
Yusaku: "And what will you do when you go back?"
Chihiro: "You can do as you please, Manager."
Yusaku: "... That's a rather bold statement."
Chihiro: "I, I can't stand being here anymore."
Yusaku: "Are you really that scared of being known?"
Chihiro: "Please, think about what will happen after you know."
Yusaku: "I wonder what will happen."
Chihiro: "I'll definitely be divorced."
Yusaku: "Certainly, that possibility isn't zero."
Chihiro: "Poor Sho-chan, being married to me like this. That's why, at least when I'm by his side, I want to be a good wife."
Yusaku: "... I see."
Chihiro: "I'll, I'll really do anything."
Yusaku: "For example?"
Chihiro: "Anything you wish, Manager."
Yusaku: "Does that include..."
Squelch...
Chihiro: "Ah...uh..."
Yusaku: "Taking my stinky balls into your mouth, and sucking on them like candy?"
Chihiro: "I, I'll suck."
Yusaku: "Spreading your pregnant pussy by yourself, letting me peek all the way to the entrance of your womb?"
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yusaku: "What about sticking your finger into your ass and smelling that scent?"
Chihiro: "Such a...thing..."
Yusaku: "So, it is impossible after all."
Chihiro: "I, I'll endure it."
Yusaku: "Really?"
Chihiro: "I, I'll endure everything."
Yusaku: "That's quite a generous offer."
Chihiro: "So... so..."
Thud...
Chihiro: "...Eh?"
Yusaku: "Rejected."
Chihiro: "Re, rejected?"
Yusaku: "Even if you can't do everything I said earlier..."
Squelch...
Chihiro: "Wai...t..."
Yusaku: "I choose this place."
Chihiro: "Why..."
Yusaku: "Didn't I say that tonight is the day to move the piece forward?"
Chihiro: "I don't understand what you're saying."
Yusaku: "You may not understand now, but you will someday."
Squelch... Squelch...
Chihiro: "Ah...!"
Yusaku: "At least by the time we arrive at the final station."
Thrust...
Chihiro: "No...!"
Yusaku: "What's wrong?"
Chihiro: "No... not the... penis."
Yusaku: "...Your expression is thrilling every time I see it."
Chihiro: "Please... don't insert it."
Yusaku: "...Your desperate voice is also fantastic."
Chihiro: "Don't insert it while I'm with Sho-chan."
Yusaku: "No need to hold back."
Slide... Pop...
Chihiro: "Ah...uh..."
Yusaku: "Look..."
*Rub*...
Chihiro: "Ah...ah..."
Yusaku: "This is what you love..."
Chihiro: "No...wait..."
Yusaku: "A dick that won't ejaculate until it's satisfied."
Chihiro: "I, I don't need it now."
Yusaku: "Now?"
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yusaku: "You just said it."
Chihiro: "It's not in a weird way..."
Yusaku: "That's a line you wouldn't have thought of a while ago."
Chihiro: "So please don't misunderstand."
Yusaku: "Sho-chan would be surprised if he heard that."
Chihiro: "You can't let him hear that."
Yusaku: "So what can he hear?"
*Thrust*
Chihiro: "Ah...!"
Yusaku: "Your sultry moans?"
Chihiro: "Why does it come to that?"
Yusaku: "If you're just unhappy with the voice..."
*Thrust... push...*
Chihiro: "Ah... ya..."
Yusaku: "Shall we show Sho-chan us actually having sex?"
Chihiro: "If you do that, you too..."
Yusaku: "...You want to say it would be troublesome."
Chihiro: "It's... It's impossible not to be troubled."
Yusaku: "Let's check then."
I breathe in so Chihiro can hear.
I cast a meaningful glance in his direction.
Yusaku: "Let's call him here and see how troubled I am."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
It was quite a serious mode.
Her bluffs are like feathers dancing in the wind.
Chihiro: "No, no."
Yusaku: "What's wrong?"
Chihiro: "You can't call him."
Yusaku: "What should I do?"
*Thrust... push... ugh...*
Chihiro: "Ah...!"
The swollen glans passes through the vaginal opening.
Of course, Chihiro isn't going to stay still either.
She twists her body like a lamb huddling in fear.
*Slick...*
Chihiro: "Hi...i...n..."
But she can't escape.
The drenched valley only gets more familiar.
She's forced to let out an unwilling sob.
Yusaku: "Your voice is getting louder..."
Chihiro: "U... ha... ha..."
Yusaku: "It seems I'm not the one to call him."
*Thrust... push... push...*
Chihiro: "Iya... ah... ya..."
Yusaku: "He must be familiar with these moans."
*Thrust... push... push... squelch...*
Chihiro: "Hi...i..."
Yusaku: "Once your sweet voice reaches his ears, he'll come running straight here."
Chihiro: "Please, stop it already."
Yusaku: "Just when we're getting heated?"
Chihiro: "I... I love my husband."
Yusaku: "I've heard that line so many times, it's rotten."
Chihiro: "I don't want to ruin my life with him."
Yusaku: "Seeing his violated wife might make him fall in love all over again."
Chihiro: "W-what an impossible thing to say..."
*sound effect*
Chihiro: "That's why... you can't put it in..."
*sound effect*
Chihiro: "W-wait... really... going in... Ahh... Ahh..."
*sound effect*
Chihiro: "Ahh... Ahh... No... Ahh... Haah... No... No... Ehh..."
*sound effect*
Chihiro: "~~~~~~~~~~~."
A moan that couldn't turn into a voice.
Except for her breasts, her whole body went rigid.
She held back all her sobs inside her.
On the contrary, the juices that lost their escape route spurted out from her vagina.
Juicy, indecent sounds leaked from the gaps.
Of course, the penis sank deep inside, as much as it could fit.
No matter how wet it was, her tight vagina remained the same.
Its squeeze was ruthless, like a very thick rubber band.
Chihiro: "Uhh... Haah... Haah... Haah..."
Yusaku: "Congratulations on managing to not make a sound."
Chihiro: "... Haah... Haah... Idiot..."
Yusaku: "If you don't want to call your dear husband that much..."
*sound effect*
Chihiro: "Haa... Ah..."
Yusaku: "You just need to hold back your moaning like now."
Chihiro: "I... I can't..."
Yusaku: "If there's love, you can do it, right?"
Chihiro: "I... I might be able to hold back at first, but not forever."
Yusaku: "Already complaining before I start moving my dick?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Can't be helped then..."
Chihiro: "~~~~~~~~~~~."
Yusaku: "Ku... Ha... Ah..."
*sound effect*
Yusaku: "Th-this is amazing."
*sound effect*
Chihiro: "Haaa... Ah... Ah... Ah..."
Yusaku: "Ku... Ah..."
*sound effect*
Chihiro: "It... it's coming out... Your... it's coming out... inside... coming out..."
*sound effect*
Chihiro: "Hi... ku... uh..."
*sound effect*
Chihiro: "Se, section manager... your heat... it's overflowing... more... more..."
Yusaku: "..."
*sound effect*
Chihiro: "Haaa... it's still coming out... feels good..."
*sound effect*
Chihiro: "Ah..."
*sound effect*
Chihiro: "No... it's not true..."
*sound effect*
Chihiro: "I'm... I'm going to climax again..."
Chihiro: "I... I can't stop... Haa... Haa... Amazing..."
Chihiro: "I... I don't know this... Haa... Haa... Sho-chan... feels good... feels good..."
*sound effect*
Chihiro: "Hiii... Your... your penis... it's not moving... why...?"
*sound effect*
Chihiro: "I, I'm coming... again... Haaa... I'm coming... Ahhh... I... I must... suppress... my voice... Higu... Hii... I... I'm coming... I'm coming harder than before... coming... coming... uh..."
Chihiro: "Haaa... I'm falling... it's... it's scary... Haa... I'm falling... Ahhh... Ah... section manager... I'm falling... falling... noooo... I'm... falling..."
...
Dear wife.
Are you a little happier than before?
But for me, this is far from enough.
It's far from the ultimate goal I'm aiming for.
But somehow, we'll reach it.
The final destination you and I are heading towards.
For that, I need to increase the tracks that are carved out one by one.
I have to prepare you in the best possible state.
Not just the masochistic tendency that reacts to torment and pain.
But also another bud of lust that you possess.
If it's for the sake of making it bloom, I won't hesitate to take risks.
I'll prepare as many extras as necessary...
...
...
...
This is a conscious Sho-chan, different from that time.
