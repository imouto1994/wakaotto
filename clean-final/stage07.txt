...The next day, 1 PM...
Yusaku: "..."
She came.
It was worth the wait.
This is a pottery antique shop in the shopping district.
There, I've been playing the part of a casual customer for a long time.
Of course, I'm not really looking at the merchandise.
My gaze is fixed on the street.
Yes.
I've been waiting for you to pass by.
Are you going to your cooking class in jeans today?
It's damn hot, must be tough.
...
Oh my.
You're acting pretty suspicious.
You, a wife, looking around restlessly.
I can feel your anxiety just by watching.
You're subconsciously on guard, aren't you?
Aware of my presence.
Don't worry.
I won't get close enough to enter your field of vision.
That's why I'm keeping quite a distance this time.
So much so that your big ass looks like a tiny bean.
...
Clatter, rumble, clatter, rumble.
Yusaku: "..."
Even on the train, you're looking around.
You, a wife, deliberately seek out a place with few people.
You're standing alone, not even holding onto the handrails.
You definitely won't get close to the doors, will you?
I understand how you feel.
You never want to experience something like that again.
Having your precious parts touched by a man other than your husband.
It must have traumatized you, right?
Yusaku: "Hmph..."
I grin from the next carriage.
While observing Chihiro's situation, I press a button on my mobile phone.
"Center of the 3rd car."
I type only this and send a mass email.
The pictures I took in the room have already been published.
So anyone should be able to recognize Chihiro.
To all the molesters I gathered on the internet.
I'm going to sit back and watch from here.
...
Oh.
They're quick to act.
Two, three guys who look the part have moved from the 2nd car, phone in hand.
Another suspicious fat guy follows.
He's from the 4th car where I am.
I was probably in his way, standing near the aisle.
He pushed me aside with his log-like arms.
Of course, these are guys I don't know.
I glare back at him with a smirk.
The fat guy makes a disgusted face.
Just go already.
Your prey is right there.
...
This is amazing.
As expected, a beauty attracts a different number of people.
In no time, about 10 people.
Only around you, wife, it's getting unusually crowded.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
You've noticed.
Chihiro tries to move away sensing the ominous atmosphere.
But the men nonchalantly block her path.
An exquisite team play.
The encircling ring is getting smaller and smaller.
While confining the woman, the guys move to a corner.
As much as possible, to a place that doesn't stand out.
The wife's face is already pale.
Well, of course.
It's not like ants swarming to sugar.
It's more like a lamb being devoured by piranhas, isn't it?
Chihiro: "Hic..."
There are about 20 hands reaching out indiscriminately.
With this many, it's impossible to fend them off.
Your entire body is being touched.
Poor thing, even your mouth is being covered.
In less than five minutes.
Your hellish time will continue.
How does it feel?
To be everyone's wife?
Wearing jeans doesn't matter, does it?
The guys' target is your attractive breasts.
As expected, there's a reason why I disseminated the information in advance.
Thanks to that, it's a battle for your boobs.
A guy trying to move Chihiro's arm.
A guy trying to sneak under it without hesitation.
They were all trying to grab the swell first.
But they are big, aren't they?
You can tell the volume just by looking.
Hands reaching out from all directions.
Under that pressure, the voluptuous flesh is moving here and there.
Aren't they almost spilling out of the bra?
So obscenely erotic.
Just watching makes my dick hard.
Yusaku: "..."
I quietly move to the top of the coupler.
I take out my phone so as not to be noticed by those around.
I point the lens through the gaps of the swarming crowd.
Nice.
It's sexy.
It seems like I could hear your sobbing from here.
Do you make that face when you're having sex too?
Chihiro: "Hic...ah..."
Damn it, who did it?
Who unzipped the jeans?
That's not what we agreed.
This time it's only from above the clothes.
No touching directly or undressing.
As expected, Chihiro resists more than ever.
She's slapping and grabbing the hands sneaking in.
There's a little way to the station.
Hang in there.
You claim you belong to your husband only.
...
Just barely safe.
Finally, we've arrived at the station.
As the speed slows, the encirclement loosens.
The wife, her face bright red, slips out of the gap.
With the bag slung over her shoulder, she's smacking the guys.
You're brave.
Despite being physically and emotionally wrecked.
Your face looks like you're about to cry.
The moment the doors open, she runs out onto the platform.
Of course, I get off too.
I have to make sure you go to your cooking class.
There's no need to keep distance anymore.
She's lost the leeway to look back.
Her pace quickens.
She's skipping steps on the stairs.
That's not good.
Such wide strides don't suit a lady like you.
Even if you're naked, you should walk elegantly.
In that state, Chihiro goes to the station restroom.
She enters as if pushing herself in, with her gaze down.
Are you planning to sob in there?
I wait for a while.
I have no choice but to watch the situation from the shadow of a kiosk.
...
Oh.
She's already come out.
That was quick if she was crying.
Just a restroom break?
Chihiro's steps are now heavy, as if she's changed.
The drooping figure from behind looks as if she's carrying all the unhappiness in the world.
Yet, there's an uneasiness.
That's strange.
Yusaku: "..."
I watch her walk away.
Change of plan.
I direct my steps straight to the women's restroom.
It's okay.
Probably no one's in there now.
It's my instinct, honed from years of dirty deeds.
Yusaku: "..."
Like a gentle breeze, I enter the restroom.
If you're too cautious in times like these, you draw more attention.
What greeted me was the unique odor filling the place.
I inhale it fully and open each stall one by one.
The furthest stall is the one that strikes me.
A familiar scent faintly remains.
Just like a dog.
Mocking myself, I place my hand on the toilet seat.
No warmth at all.
It doesn't seem like she used the restroom.
What on earth did she go to the toilet for?
Yusaku: "...?"
The trash can in the corner of the stall.
On closer look, the lid is halfway open.
I hook it with my foot and open it widely.
Yusaku: "...What's this?"
Inside is a balled-up pair of panties.
The color is white.
They look very freshly taken off.
I pinch it with my fingertips and hold it up in front of me.
The sexual fluids, still damp and fresh.
They were sticky on the important part.
Yusaku: "Huh..."
I see.
So that's what it is.
You're an interesting woman.
Come to think of it, you were wet when I molested you.
It's not a coincidence the second time.
This seems to be deeper than I thought.
What are you hiding behind your modesty?
I've started to want to know, no matter what it takes...
...
...
...
Yusaku: "Hey, Section Chief."
Shota: "Y-Yes, Chief."
Yusaku: "Deliver these documents to the branch office in the next town."
Shota: "U-Understood."
Yusaku: "Make sure to show your face properly. I've called and told them our hope is coming."
Shota: "I'll do my best not to cause any trouble for the Chief."
Yusaku: "And go straight home today. I have a favor to ask first thing tomorrow morning, and you should rest your body once in a while."
Shota: "Oh, thank you very much. If there's anything urgent, please call my cell phone."
Yusaku: "..."
He's quite eager.
The time is exactly 2 p.m.
With this, the nuisance is gone.
I quickly send an email to Chihiro.
Of course, I already obtained the address from Akizuki's cell phone.
When I handed him the dismissal letter, I made sure to sneak a peek.
Ideally, I want to finish things before she returns from the cooking class.
I quickly send the text I prepared last night.
Congratulations on the group molestation.
For those who want photos, please contact the following.
Yusaku Zama, Budget Compilation Section, Finance Bureau, Shiawase no Oka City Hall.
※ We will accept until 4 p.m. today.
※ Please refrain from inquiries by phone.
Yusaku: "Hehe..."
Nice.
There's no need to talk directly.
This is more than enough.
Or will you ignore something like an email?
After being made to open your legs wide, you can't sit still.
You, who would even chase after me.
You can't ignore it.
Because you, ma'am, are already on the brink.
You're more cornered than you think.
If so, come flying to me honestly.
I'll give you a full lecture in the reception room about the situation you're in now...
...
Chihiro: "...?"
I opened my bag to take out a band-aid.
I immediately noticed the blue light blinking.
An email from someone.
But I'm not in a state to deal with that right now.
I can't concentrate on anything.
Even when I'm cooking, my mind is not here.
Thanks to that, I've even cut my finger.
Cooking Teacher: "Akizuki-san."
Chihiro: "Y-Yes."
Cooking Teacher: "Are you really okay?"
Chihiro: "...I'm fine."
This is the third time I've been worried about.
One is because my complexion is terrible.
The other is because I'm not focused no matter what I'm taught.
And it hasn't changed.
I forgot to look for the band-aid before I knew it.
As if I was hypnotized, I was staring at the blinking blue light.
Chihiro: "..."
What am I doing?
I have to stop this.
First, let's stop this annoying blinking.
As if I was looking for a band-aid, I open the folded cell phone.
Who is it from?
An unfamiliar phone number.
Suspicious.
It might be another email from an unknown sender.
But the next moment.
The moment I saw the title, my body felt as if it was struck by lightning.
"Congratulations on the Group Molestation"
What is this?
My heartbeat begins to sound like an alarm bell.
Even though the blinking of the lamp is gone, I can't take my eyes off the cell phone.
The more I read the message, the more my hand starts to shake.
Chihiro: "...Te-Teacher."
A rather loud voice.
But I couldn't even turn around.
The air of curiosity I feel behind me.
I'm afraid of the cold stares.
Just a little more hurt, and my mind might break.
Chihiro: "Please, let me leave early."
I bow down and hurry to my seat.
I put the knife in my bag.
I cram the half-finished dish into the Tupperware.
The teacher is saying something.
But I don't understand.
I can hear it, but I can't comprehend it.
I need to leave quickly.
I need to escape from here quickly.
Quickly, quickly, quickly...
...
