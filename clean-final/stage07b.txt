Shota: "So, when I was talking with the head of the branch office..."
Yusaku: "Chief Akizuki."
Shota: "Y-Yes."
Yusaku: "You're only talking about work, your wife must be bored."
Shota: "Ah, I'm sorry... Were you bored?"
Chihiro: "N-No."
Yusaku: "How about you have a little drink, ma'am?"
Chihiro: "...No...I..."
Yusaku: "Don't be shy, go ahead."
Chihiro: "W-Well then..."
Just for the form.
I don't intend to take in alcohol.
I don't want it to harm the baby.
Shota: "If you get drunk, I'll take care of you."
Chihiro: "...Th-Thank you."
Yusaku: "..."
Section Chief Kazama tilts a bottle of beer.
He keeps staring at me while he pours.
Like a frog being stared down by a snake.
And a snake with its legs indecently spread.
Yusaku: "You're quite strong, aren't you?"
Chihiro: "...My face turns red with just one glass."
Yusaku: "I'd like to see that."
Shota: "I mean, it's a bit inappropriate for me to say this, but she is quite sensual."
Chihiro: "Oh, you..."
Shota: "But it's true."
Yusaku: "Hmm..."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Section Chief Kazama arrived around 7 pm.
Right after dinner, he started to be mean again.
Just like yesterday, he made me spread my legs.
I've been in this position for over an hour.
Of course, I can't complain.
There's no way I can.
The only time I can return to normal is when I stand up.
But as soon as I sit down, he demands with his gaze.
"Spread your legs"
I reluctantly obey.
Because I have to.
The shame of my own action doubles.
Probably, that's the Section Chief's intention.
He seems to find satisfaction in humiliating me.
But why?
What's so fun about doing this?
Chihiro: "..."
I'll stop thinking.
There's no point in trying to find answers now.
Yusaku: "...Here you go."
Chihiro: "Th-Thank you."
Yusaku: "Oh?"
Chihiro: "Uh..."
What is it this time?
Please don't say anything strange.
I'm upset by his suggestive tone.
I stop moving with the glass still at my mouth.
Yusaku: "Your armpits are red."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Whose fault is that?
The part where Section Chief Kazama's semen was spilled.
There's no way I could just leave it.
I got home just after 5 in the evening.
As soon as I got home, I jumped into the bathroom.
Scrub, scrub, scrub.
Washing to the point where I thought my skin would peel off.
The arm holding the glass is the one that was violated.
Of course, the elbow is raised, and the armpit is exposed.
Shota: "...What's wrong?"
Chihiro: "A-Ah..."
Please, Shota.
Don't look at me.
Look straight ahead.
The armpit is still fine.
But I don't want him to notice my lower half.
I want to close it right now.
But the Section Chief's gaze doesn't allow it.
Even the glass I was holding is still there.
I was frozen as if I had been plastered.
Shota: "Did you get bitten by a mosquito?"
Chihiro: "M-Maybe..."
Yusaku: "That must be a pretty intense mosquito. Quite a wide area has turned red."
Chihiro: "...I couldn't stand it, and I scratched it."
Yusaku: "Hmm..."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
The Section Chief is grinning.
He's probably going to say something else.
Yusaku: "So, the madam raises her arm and scratches her armpit?"
Chihiro: "Y-Yes, that's right."
Yusaku: "It's hard to imagine that scene."
Shota: "...Certainly, it doesn't seem like Chihiro..."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
I can't take it anymore.
Shota, looking up at the sky.
He's definitely imagining me.
Shota: "I think it's cute, though."
Yusaku: "Flaunting your affection in front of me?"
Shota: "S-Sorry."
He bowed his head slightly.
But he's not overly apologetic like yesterday.
Now it feels more like a normal boss and subordinate relationship.
He's acting naturally in front of the Section Chief.
Brimming with confidence.
His work is going smoothly with his new position.
Everything must be going well for him.
Chihiro: "..."
Somehow I'm starting to feel sad.
I feel like I'm about to cry.
I put the glass I was holding onto the table.
Pretending something got in my eye, I rubbed it.
Yusaku: "Is something wrong, madam?"
Chihiro: "N-No... not really..."
The castle on the sand that I'm trying to protect.
And me, shivering at its base.
Something is starting to change on its own.
Little by little, little by little.
As if peeling off the thin skin that was attached.
If I resist it, the castle will probably crumble.
If that happens, Shota will be buried in the sand.
Never to be bathed in warm sunlight again.
At least in terms of our relationship.
That's why I'm spreading my legs.
To make sure the precious castle doesn't disappear.
But what about next time?
Show the Section Chief our sex?
That's impossible.
It goes without saying that it's too outrageous.
Above all, I didn't want to involve him.
I don't mind being the only one embarrassed.
I have to find a way to avoid this.
Even if I have to put my forehead to the floor to get forgiveness...
...
...
...
Shota: "Section Chief, please use it first."
Yusaku: "I'm fine, go take a bath. Don't be shy, it's your own home."
Shota: "But..."
Yusaku: "Make sure to sober up. We're inspecting the new government building site together tomorrow."
Shota: "Y-Yes."
Yusaku: "..."
Yusaku: "...Hmm."
He went off to the bathroom by himself.
He was yawning leisurely.
It's 10 p.m.
Everything is going according to plan.
Of course, his stay was decided long ago.
Misleading that idiot is easy.
"It might be more comfortable for both of us to sleep here than meeting somewhere else."
No persuasion needed with that one line.
He nodded like a nodding doll.
The wife just listens quietly.
Unable to do anything but smile and nod at her husband's words, seeking approval.
Yusaku: "..."
Chihiro, in the middle of cleaning up.
But now she takes a break.
Kneeling in front of the closet.
Preparing pajamas for her husband with care?
Nice.
It feels like catching a glimpse of their everyday life.
Always serving her husband like that.
Her well-proportioned profile.
Long eyelashes.
Breasts sticking out from her slender body.
She's as sensuous as ever.
Are her cheeks rosy because she spread her legs?
Or is she excited about being watched during our night activities?
Damn it.
I want to take her right now.
But patience.
It's more fun to learn about you slowly.
A time will definitely come when I can savor you more deliciously.
Chihiro: "Umm..."
Yusaku: "..."
Chihiro leaves the front of the closet.
In her hand is a brand new pair of pajamas with a tag.
Chihiro: "I-if you don't mind, please use these."
Yusaku: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "I'll lay out the futon in the living room soon..."
Yusaku: "I don't need a futon or pajamas."
Chihiro: "...Aren't you going to sleep?"
Yusaku: "What do you think the reason is for me to come here?"
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yusaku: "Answer me."
Chihiro: "...I can't."
Yusaku: "What can't you do?"
Chihiro: "I... I can't do it."
Yusaku: "So what can't you do?"
Chihiro: "Having sex with my husband... in front of someone else..."
Yusaku: "I'm not a stranger anymore."
I smirk at my own words.
Pointing at her armpit with a grinning expression.
Yusaku: "Because you took my semen there."
Chihiro: "...I didn't do it because I wanted to."
Yusaku: "Was that so?"
Chihiro: "Back then, you forced me to..."
Yusaku: "..."
Make her realize her position with words alone.
Slap her cheek to make her realize her position.
Yusaku: "So what?"
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yusaku: "After all, you're the one who caused it."
Chihiro: "I... I didn't do anything..."
Yusaku: "It's your fault for trying to slap me first. That's why you got your arm twisted and ended up in this situation."
*Slap!*
Chihiro: "Ah!"
Yusaku: "So what?"
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Of course, it's not with all my strength.
Just enough force that it doesn't leave a mark.
But Chihiro's eyes are wide.
She seems more surprised than in pain.
Chihiro: "...Please stop being violent."
Yusaku: "Because you don't understand."
Chihiro: "You're the kind of person who resorts to violence when things don't go your way."
Yusaku: "You're also quick to raise your hand, aren't you? Even the incident where you got semen splattered in your armpit, it all started with you."
Chihiro: "Don't blame everything on me."
Yusaku: "That's why you got your arm twisted and ended up in this situation."
Chihiro: "That's because you forced me back when I was trying to leave..."
Yusaku: "So it would have been better if I hadn't stopped you."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "You really think that, don't you?"
Chihiro: "...I don't care anymore."
Yusaku: "You're lying."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "If you didn't care, you would have gone home."
Chihiro: "Because I endured, I had to go through that..."
Yusaku: "Think of it as a stroke of luck that it ended with just that. If you had chosen the other option, who knows where you'd be now."
Chihiro: "...It doesn't change the fact that I'm in a horrible situation."
Yusaku: "Oh really..."
I put my hand into my breast pocket.
Yusaku: "Is there a mailbox nearby?"
Chihiro: "...Huh?"
Yusaku: "I mean a post box."
Chihiro: "There is one on the way to the station..."
Yusaku: "I see."
Two letters peek out from the collar of my suit.
The moment she sees the names on them, Chihiro's complexion changes.
Chihiro: "Th-that... You're not..."
Yusaku: "I was thinking of having you confirm that the address isn't wrong. It would hurt my conscience if these ended up with strangers."
Chihiro: "You're writing letters to my parents too?"
Yusaku: "Either way, it's going to be an event that involves the family. It would save you the trouble of explaining everything from scratch."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "It'll become clear whether your current situation is really unchanged once these are mailed. Personally, I think there's a world of difference, though."
Chihiro: "You... You're the worst devil..."
Thank you for the compliment.
Watch your mouth.
Yusaku: "Thank you for the compliment."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yusaku: "Watch your mouth."
Chihiro: "What joy do you get from doing such things?"
Yusaku: "Tell your husband that you suddenly have an errand. Change the meeting place to the entrance of the city office at 7 a.m. tomorrow."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I grab my bag with a grin.
I leave Chihiro behind and head for the entrance.
Chihiro: "W-wait, please."
Yusaku: "You don't need me anymore, do you?"
Chihiro: "I... I do."
Yusaku: "So you've changed your mind?"
Chihiro: "Th-that... well... um..."
Yusaku: "...You're in the way of the door."
Chihiro: "Please, listen to me."
Yusaku: "Move, wife."
Chihiro: "No, I won't."
Yusaku: "I told you to move."
Chihiro: "..."
Her earlier assertiveness is gone.
Chihiro looks like she's about to cry.
This expression on her...
It's the first time I've seen it.
Thanks to that, my penis is fully erect.
It's swelling so much that I can't hide it.
Chihiro: "Please... I beg you..."
Yusaku: "If you raise your voice too much, your husband might hear you."
Chihiro: "Please... please..."
*Thud*
Yusaku: "What's this?"
Chihiro: "..."
Chihiro sits down in front of the door.
Her head bowed.
Her shoulders slumped.
She doesn't mind getting her spreading skirt dirty.
That's a good pose.
It feels good, like she's kneeling at my feet.
Yusaku: "...You know, wife."
Speak kindly.
Speak harshly.
Yusaku: "Your skirt is getting dirty."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yusaku: "The entrance isn't a place to sit, right?"
Chihiro: "If I move, you... you'll go outside..."
Yusaku: "That depends on you... come on."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "You're probably misunderstanding something..."
I deliberately take a gentle tone.
I wipe the smirk off my face and give her a teaching look.
Yusaku: "I don't intend to say we should have sex in front of everyone."
Chihiro: "Is... Is that so?"
Yusaku: "Do you want to be hit again?"
Chihiro: "No, I don't..."
Yusaku: "Then you have no choice but to stand up."
Chihiro: "..."
I roughly grab Chihiro's hair.
Then I pull it up hard.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Her face crumples even more.
She looks like she could burst into tears at any moment.
Yet, in order not to alert her husband, Chihiro is desperately holding back.
Yusaku: "I told you to stand, didn't I?"
Chihiro: "No, I don't want to..."
Yusaku: "The entrance isn't a place to sit."
Chihiro: "If I move, you... you'll go outside..."
Yusaku: "That depends on you..."
*Yank*
Chihiro: "Ah... Ah..."
Yusaku: "...It's up to you."
Chihiro: "I... I don't want to show sex..."
Yusaku: "...Listen here."
I get up close and personal...
Our noses are almost touching.
Chihiro is backed against the door.
She can't create any distance because I've come closer.
Yusaku: "No one said you have to have sex in front of everyone."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Where do you usually sleep?"
Chihiro: "...In the Japanese-style room next to the living room..."
Yusaku: "Then you should make love as usual there. Just leave the door slightly open."
Chihiro: "Th-the door... slightly... open..."
Yusaku: "You can even dim the lights. In other words, nothing changes from usual as long as you don't mind my presence."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "And you can eliminate those perverted photos. Of course, I won't spill about what happened today, so it's not a bad deal, I think."
I softened my intimidating expression a bit.
I also slightly distanced the face that was close to my nose.
I'm good at controlling the pace.
I'm used to it from my work.
Yusaku: "...What will you do?"
Chihiro: "If I... if I do as you say, will you really delete the data...?"
Yusaku: "I'll delete it in front of you. I can also tear up this letter."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Your husband should be getting out of the bath soon. If we keep making a racket here, he might get suspicious... right?"
There's no way she could shake her head in this situation.
So there's no need to wait for her to nod.
I thrust my arm under her armpit and forcefully got Chihiro to stand up.
Then, gently assisting her, we went to the living room.
Her steps were unsteady.
Her expression was like she was soulless.
She's a mess.
Even though she was so guarded before.
She even forgot to resist the closeness between us.
Or rather, she's beyond that now?
I understand that feeling.
The act that she has to perform from now on.
Her mind is filled with that thought.
And that's okay.
Thanks to that, her armor is gradually thinning.
Even now, look.
Pretending to support her, my hand rests on her shoulder.
And she hasn't noticed that the tips of my fingers are reaching the swell of her chest...
...
...
...
...Two hours later, in the Japanese-style room...
Chihiro: "...Shota, don't go to sleep."
Shota: "..."
Chihiro: "(Sigh...)"
It's hopeless.
He's not paying attention to me anymore.
He's pretending to sleep with his back turned to me.
He's confused by my unusual assertiveness.
It's only natural.
It's almost unheard of for me to initiate.
We make love when Shota wants to.
That's the unwritten rule between us.
But suddenly, I'm the one initiating.
And on a night when Yusaku-san is sleeping in the next room, of all times.
Chihiro: "..."
What should I do?
Without turning my face, I just look towards the sliding door.
Through the slight gap left open.
Is he still watching us quietly?
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I shiver.
What am I doing?
I think I'm being stupid.
I'm doing something outrageous.
But I can't help it.
There's no other way but to obey.
A temporary hell is better than eternal pain.
So I have to do something.
I try to shake Shota.
Plead with him just one more time.
But when I reach out my hand,
I hear faint snoring.
He's not pretending anymore.
He's really asleep.
I'm unsure whether to wake him up.
In the dimly lit room, I continue to hesitate.
As I do, time just passes aimlessly.
What should I do?
Yusaku-san won't back down quietly.
What should I really do?
...
Yusaku: "..."
What are you doing?
The husband remains with his back turned.
Chihiro, sitting next to him, looks troubled.
Their state hasn't changed at all.
Are you two wax figures?
The whispering voices I could hear until a while ago...
They are gone.
Enough is enough.
I'm fully erect and ready.
I'm gripping the panties I nabbed in the bathroom, ready to jerk off at any moment.
Damn it.
I was planning to have the best masturbation.
Why don't you take more initiative?
Pull down your pajama bottoms and give a blowjob.
Then straddle him as he lies on his back.
A woman who is usually too chaste.
But she should be lustful towards her husband.
Her body is ripe enough to get wet from being molested.
Hurry up and show me.
The sight of a wife having bold sex, despite her embarrassment.
Yusaku: "(Ah...)"
Finally, Chihiro begins to move.
She's timidly shaking her husband's back.
Didn't she do that earlier?
If you're going to touch him, go for his penis, his penis.
What I heard was Chihiro's voice whispering softly.
Are you awake?
What's that?
Is he really asleep?
...
You bastard.
I told you so.
If you don't start soon, that's what happens.
If he's asleep, kick him.
You can even stab him with a knife if it's just a little.
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "..."
Chihiro: "Um..."
Yusaku: "The toilet?"
Chihiro: "No, not that..."
Yusaku: "Why did you close the sliding door?"
Chihiro: "I, I thought it'd be better if my husband couldn't hear..."
Yusaku: "It's fine to leave it open since you're coming right back."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "...He seems to be asleep."
Chihiro: "What?"
Yusaku: "Your husband."
Chihiro: "...I'm sorry."
Yusaku: "I don't think this is a problem that can be solved with an apology."
Chihiro: "There was nothing I could do."
Yusaku: "Even though all you did was shake his back?"
Chihiro: "...I also spoke to him properly."
Yusaku: "What did you say?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Answer me."
Chihiro: "We haven't made love for a while..."
Yusaku: "What's the point of saying it in such a roundabout way, idiot."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "What actions accompanied that?"
Chihiro: "...So I shook his back..."
Yusaku: "That's obviously weak. Even without that, he would find it hard to do it with me in the next room."
Chihiro: "...What should I have done?"
Yusaku: "..."
Damn it.
Are you mocking me?
Yusaku: "You two are married, right?"
Chihiro: "Yes, we are."
Yusaku: "Then is it something you should ask me?"
Chihiro: "...I asked because I didn't know."
Yusaku: "You should have been more active, licking."
Chihiro: "Lick, lick?"
Yusaku: "It's a blowjob, a blowjob. Don't make me explain everything."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Just like now, you should have opened your mouth and sucked him."
Chihiro: "...Even if my husband isn't in the mood?"
Yusaku: "If the wife is in the mood, it's not a problem."
Chihiro: "But for me to do it unilaterally..."
Yusaku: "There are times like that in a marriage, right?"
Chihiro: "...No, there aren't."
Yusaku: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "There's never been a time like that."
Yusaku: "You're lying."
Chihiro: "No, I'm not lying."
Yusaku: "You've never initiated?"
Chihiro: "Even this much... I've never..."
Yusaku: "So, what do you do when you want it?"
Chihiro: "...What?"
Yusaku: "Do you hug him and kiss him like a child?"
Chihiro: "Well, that much, yes."
Yusaku: "That's also part of seduction."
Chihiro: "I don't do that because I want sex..."
Yusaku: "..."
I'm dumbfounded.
With those big breasts, what is she saying?
Yusaku: "Never mind."
Chihiro: "...Is it really that strange?"
Yusaku: "I get it, you're a saint with no sexual desire."
Chihiro: "No one said that."
Yusaku: "You should just pray next to your husband."
Chihiro: "I just..."
Yusaku: "Well, you're the type of woman who sleeps in her bra, so your only pride is your integrity."
Chihiro: "That's why I..."
Yusaku: "Besides that, you have no charm, just a pig that eats and sleeps."
Chihiro: "That's harsh."
Yusaku: "I'm disappointed in you."
Chihiro: "Don't order me to do weird things and then get disappointed on your own."
Yusaku: "...If you raise your voice, your husband will wake up."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
I gave Chihiro a sign.
Half in disbelief, I pointed to the bathroom door.
Yusaku: "If you want to get angry, do it here."
Chihiro: "It's strange not to get angry after being called a pig."
Yusaku: "...Shut up."
Chihiro: "!?"
The underwear that was covering my penis until a moment ago.
I threw it at Chihiro in anger.
Chihiro: "What is this...?"
Yusaku: "It's obviously the crunchy panties I picked up in the toilet. A woman who pretends to be decent even in front of her husband, shouldn't be getting wet down there."
Chihiro: "...You're the worst."
Yusaku: "That's about yourself."
Chihiro: "So, you were following me. To secretly carry the things I threw away in the women's toilet... you're just a savage."
Yusaku: "It's your fault for being so careless."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "Well, see ya."
Chihiro: "If you're going home, please tear up the letter."
Yusaku: "I'm surprised that you, who doesn't keep promises, would say such a thing."
Click.
Chihiro: "Wait..."
Yusaku: "There's no point in me being here anymore."
Chihiro: "..."
If I'm serious, it's easy to push her away.
I picked up my shoes and went out alone.
I just kept going down the stairs.
Behind me was Chihiro in her pajamas.
Desperately grabbing the back of my suit.
Chihiro: "The... the letter..."
Yusaku: "I'll mail it properly, so don't worry."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Go back to your room."
Chihiro: "No."
Yusaku: "Are you planning to go outside dressed like that?"
Chihiro: "If you think so, stop."
Yusaku: "For whose sake?"
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "You're still a shameless woman."
Chihiro: "Just let me talk to you."
Yusaku: "Hmph..."
No matter how much she pulls, it's useless.
I won't stop.
On the contrary, she's just being dragged.
The pathetic sound of footsteps from behind.
Of course.
She's not even wearing sandals.
Barefoot in pajamas.
Pathetic.
That's why it suits you right now.
It's the perfect appearance for crying and clinging.
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Shall I escort you to the mailbox like this?"
Chihiro: "Don't walk anymore."
Yusaku: "...What should I do?"
Chihiro's face is bright red.
She wraps both her arms around my waist and clings to me desperately.
Of course, she doesn't care if her breasts are pressed against me.
The meat mass was sticking so tightly that I suspected it was on purpose.
Yusaku: "...I can't help it, so I'll stop for a bit."
Chihiro: "R-really?"
Yusaku: "It's thanks to your big breasts."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "It's over 90 centimeters, isn't it?"
Chihiro: "That doesn't matter now."
Yusaku: "Indeed, it may be a trivial problem now."
I stared at Chihiro's entire body with a grin.
I even gaze at her from the top of her head to her toes.
Yusaku: "You're dressed in a way that makes those big breasts look hazy."
Chihiro: "Where do I have the time to change..."
Yusaku: "While telling yourself that, you're quite nervous, aren't you?"
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "Running into someone you know."
Chihiro: "...Please, go back to the room."
Yusaku: "I don't want to."
Chihiro: "Why not?"
Yusaku: "It's closer to the mailbox here."
Chihiro: "You really intend to send that letter..."
Yusaku: "What are you talking about now?"
Chihiro: "If you do that, we..."
Yusaku: "Make a clean break and get a divorce."
Chihiro: "Don't say such irresponsible things."
Yusaku: "If you can't have sex with your husband, there's no need to be married, is there?"
Chihiro: "We do have sex."
Yusaku: "You don't."
Chihiro: "...We do it properly."
The word divorce doubles her desperation.
Unconsciously, her voice also becomes a size larger.
Immediately after that, there's a flicker of fluorescent light from the window.
It's just behind us, the room on the first floor.
Yusaku: "...It seems they heard."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
She turns around in a big panic.
Considering the content of the conversation, it's obvious.
Frantically, frantically.
She's panicking so much it's almost comical.
Chihiro: "Here, here..."
Yusaku: "...What is it?"
Chihiro: "..."
Chihiro, who has grabbed my wrist.
Straight to the side of the apartment building.
Despite being barefoot and unable to brace herself, she shows a strength as if she's wearing mountain climbing boots.
It's amazing when reputation comes into play.
Is my shame Shou's shame?
Chihiro: "Haa... Haa..."
Yusaku: "Good thing your face wasn't seen."
Chihiro: "If only you, Chief, would go back to the room..."
Yusaku: "The saint shouldn't blame others."
Chihiro: "Please, stop already."
Yusaku: "What should I stop?"
Chihiro: "That word, saint."
Yusaku: "Would you prefer pig woman?"
Chihiro: "Of course I hate both."
Yusaku: "...You became confident as soon as we came here."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "Just because it's less crowded than the road, the situation hasn't changed a bit."
Chihiro: "...I know that."
Yusaku: "Don't get cocky just because you're having sex with your husband."
Chihiro: "I'm not being arrogant."
Yusaku: "Even that is doubtful."
Chihiro: "...We're a couple, so it's natural to love each other."
Yusaku: "How often is this 'natural'? Once a week?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "If you don't answer, it's definitely a lie."
Chihiro: "...Two or three times."
Yusaku: "That seems a little low for being married for one year..."
Chihiro: "Isn't it different for each person?"
Yusaku: "Is it none of my business?"
Chihiro: "...I think it's irrelevant to you, Chief."
Yusaku: "Then I won't say anything unnecessary anymore. I'll end our conversation."
Chihiro: "Please end it after you tear up the letter."
Yusaku: "Curse yourself for not being able to keep your promise."
Chihiro: "Your demands, Chief... are too unreasonable."
Yusaku: "Blaming me while ignoring your own clumsiness. You're one to talk, not being able to even seduce your husband."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "After all, you're a saint who even refuses fellatio."
Chihiro: "...I've done it before."
Yusaku: "That must be a lie."
Chihiro: "I, I have done it."
Yusaku: "You've taken a penis in your mouth?"
Chihiro: "...Yes."
Yusaku: "No way."
Chihiro: "I'm not a child, you know."
Yusaku: "Oh..."
I grin.
I peer into Chihiro's face to verify the truth.
Yusaku: "If you insist that much..."
Staring...
Chihiro: "!?"
Yusaku: "...Try giving it a little suck."
Chihiro: "What kind of person are you...?"
Yusaku: "I'll verify whether you're telling the truth or not."
Chihiro: "Where is the need for such a thing?"
Yusaku: "...It's necessary."
I take an envelope from his breast pocket.
I'm waving it in front of Chihiro, as if about to rip it.
Yusaku: "If it's a blowjob, you can avoid getting your husband involved."
Chihiro: "..."
What do you think?
That line should hit the mark, right?
Yusaku: "If there are no lies in your words, I'll also erase the perverted pictures."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "This time it's something you can handle alone. Whether you deliver the letter or not, it's easier for me to decide."
Her previously defiant attitude is now nowhere to be seen.
Being cornered, Chihiro starts trembling, without a way out.
She can't even think of any bold words to say.
All that's left is for her to passionately protest how unreasonable my proposal is.
Chihiro: "If someone comes, it will be irreparable."
Yusaku: "Leave that to luck."
Chihiro: "...I can't just leave it to luck, I live here."
Yusaku: "If you feel that way, you can go back to your room."
Chihiro: "I'll go back if you rip it up."
Yusaku: "If you go back without doing anything, it'll go into the postbox, right?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "What will you do?"
Chihiro: "...I'm married."
Yusaku: "So?"
Chihiro: "I can't do it with anyone other than my husband."
Yusaku: "A wife can do it."
Chihiro: "I'm not that kind of woman."
Yusaku: "But you could save the husband you love by doing it?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "If this letter gets out, it'll be like walking on pins and needles. It's worse for him, being blamed directly, than for you."
Chihiro: "Stop it."
Yusaku: "The scorn from family can be pretty harsh."
Yusaku: "..."
Yusaku: "Huh?"
Chihiro, who had run off at full speed...
She was suddenly gone.
What's happening?
Has she lost her mind?
The sound of a door being slammed shut in the distance.
And then the unique sound of bare feet getting closer at a tremendous pace.
This isn't normal.
Chihiro: "Haah... Haah... Ah..."
Yusaku: "Did you go rinse your mouth or something?"
Chihiro: "Rip up the letter."
Yusaku: "...What are you hiding behind your back?"
Chihiro: "..."
The dull silver light reflected in the moonlight.
This is bad.
Yusaku: "...That's meant for cooking, isn't it?"
Chihiro: "If you don't tear it up, I'll die right here."
Yusaku: "Cut the bad joke."
Chihiro: "..."
Chihiro, who had the sharp end against her throat.
Are you kidding me?
You're going to exchange a blowjob for your life?
That's impossible.
Yusaku: "...Hand over the knife."
I close the distance, unfazed.
Chihiro: "No, no."
Yusaku: "Your husband will be sad if you get hurt."
A gaze that freezes the other person.
With her own hesitation, Chihiro couldn't move at all.
I hold my breath and extend my arm.
The target is the hand gripping the knife.
Without doing anything, I loosened my fist.
And just like that, I gently wrapped Chihiro's wrist.
Yusaku: "...Lower it slowly."
Chihiro: "..."
Hey, hey.
You've got to be kidding me.
Being caught seemed to be a trigger.
Like a switch had been flipped, she was really trying to stab me.
I have to go full throttle too.
I have no choice but to hold her down with both hands, not just one.
Chihiro: "Let go."
Yusaku: "That's my line."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Don't stagger, idiot.
There's nothing to lean on behind you.
Yet Chihiro wouldn't let go of the knife.
Yusaku: "Put your hand down."
The body leaning back.
Our feet entwine.
It's over.
I let go of one hand and went to Chihiro's back.
And just like that, we fell in a heap.
Thud...splash!!
Yusaku: "Ugh..."
What the?
My chest is burning hot.
I roll onto my back.
It's less painful that way.
In front of me is Chihiro's pale face.
Even though it's close, it looks terribly blurry.
Yusaku: "...What happened?"
Chihiro: "It's...it's stuck in..."
Yusaku: "What is?"
Chihiro: "The...the knife...in your chest..."
Yusaku: "...Whose?"
I couldn't lift my head to see.
I had no choice but to move my eyes.
I directed my gaze towards something sticking out.
Amazing.
My white shirt is completely red.
Fresh blood is gushing out like a fountain.
Chihiro: "Ca...call an ambulance..."
Yusaku: "...It's pointless."
Chihiro: "..."
If I survive this, I'm a monster.
It's stuck right in the middle of the heart.
And half the blade is hidden deep.
Yusaku: "..."
The rapidly disappearing consciousness.
I'm amazed at my pathetic end.
What is this?
Is this even possible?
Yusaku: "Hey..."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Somehow I managed to grab Chihiro's hand.
I then guided it to my own crotch.
Madam...
Grasp my dick.
I don't care if your hand is shaking.
I want you to remember my warmth.
That way...
I'm sure you can go straight to your bed without hesitation, even after I'm gone.
You will firmly grip my colorless, transparent, huge penis.
You're going to play with me until you're in ecstasy.
So, let's get on with it.
Next to your beloved husband...
...
......
.........
Chihiro: "Stop... stop..."
Yusaku: "Are you going to leave your husband to die?"
I bit the letter I was holding in my mouth.
I exposed my ever-hot penis from my pants.
Chihiro's face, crumpled and hardened.
Yet, escaping from this situation is impossible.
She knows that better than anyone.
Yusaku: "You're the only one who can save him."
Chihiro: "I... I don't want to save him, I just want to return things to how they were."
Yusaku: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "He didn't do anything wrong, I just... I just sowed the seeds... It's not about saving..."
Yusaku: "If that's the case, then take responsibility and reap what you've sown."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "This isn't about pleasing me, right?"
Chihiro: "Of course it isn't."
Yusaku: "Then it doesn't count as betraying your husband, does it?"
Rip.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I returned the letter I was biting to my hand, tearing just a little bit off the end.
Yusaku: "You're doing this reluctantly just to do me a favor. I'm sure he'd forgive you."
Chihiro: "Don't interpret things in your own way."
Yusaku: "I'll give you 5 more seconds."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "5..."
Chihiro: "No, stop."
Yusaku: "4..."
Chihiro: "Stop counting."
Yusaku: "3..."
Chihiro: "Why do I always have to do such terrible things..."
Yusaku: "2..."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "1..."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "... Once I start walking this time, I'll never stop again."
Chihiro: "Wait..."
Yusaku: "What should I wait for?"
Chihiro: "I'll do it... just wait... please..."
Chihiro's eyes are vacant.
She approaches with ghostly steps.
She barely manages to stand in front of me.
She then extends her arm as if clinging to me.
I collapsed onto the ground, drained of all strength, sliding down clumsily.
