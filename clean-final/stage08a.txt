...
Shota: "It's about time..."
Yusaku: "I know that."
Shota: "Y-yes."
Chihiro: "..."
This is the first aid room of the station.
Chihiro is lying on the bench seat.
His wife, who lost consciousness while her genitalia twitched.
She collapsed while clinging to her husband.
It's an outcome I didn't expect.
Did it feel that good?
So good that she couldn't bear it without fainting.
Shota: "I'm sorry for causing trouble."
Yusaku: "Everyone gets sick sometimes."
Shota: "I was surprised when she suddenly collapsed."
Yusaku: "Well, it's good it happened just before we arrived at the station."
Shota: "...Yes, it is."
Akitsuki seems very unsettled.
He keeps looking at his beloved wife's face with worry.
For now, there are no signs of her regaining consciousness.
She's just breathing quietly, as if she's fallen into a deep sleep.
The only thing that tells the truth about why she's lying there...
It's the faint wrinkle between her eyebrows.
Yusaku: "Stay with her until she wakes up."
Shota: "I-is that okay?"
Yusaku: "You can't leave your precious wife, can you?"
Shota: "But then what about the inspection..."
Yusaku: "I guess I'll have to go alone. That annoying perverted official is coming too. I don't know what he'll say if I'm late."
I check the documents in my bag.
Of course, it's all a prelude to pressing him for a decision.
Yusaku: "Explain the questions briefly."
Shota: "Huh?"
Yusaku: "What should I focus on?"
Shota: "Uh, well..."
Yusaku: "I haven't looked at the documents you put together yet."
Shota: "Is that so?"
Yusaku: "If I'm flustered on the spot, it'll be a disgrace to the budget planning department. It's not fair to you, who worked so hard to prepare."
Shota: "..."
Akitsuki, panicking.
Desperately spreading out the documents handed to him.
But that lasts only a few seconds.
His expression quickly changes to one of confusion.
It's understandable.
There's only about five minutes left to avoid being late.
It's not something that can be explained in that time.
Shota: "There's no way I can cover everything."
Yusaku: "Giving up so easily isn't like you."
Shota: "B-but..."
I subtly stroke his pride.
While it may seem like I'm cautioning him, I'm actually leading him up the tree.
Yusaku: "Let's think of a good way."
Shota: "Y-yes."
Yusaku: "I can't exactly swap brains with you, can I?"
Shota: "I do remember all the items to confirm..."
Yusaku: "How about we communicate via cell phone?"
Shota: "With me... here?"
Yusaku: "Who else is there?"
Shota: "Y-yes..."
Yusaku: "I'll just ask the contractor directly."
Shota: "I think it would be better if you looked at the documents..."
Yusaku: "Really?"
Shota: "I have to answer their questions too."
Yusaku: "So you're saying you'll be flustered either way."
Shota: "..."
Akitsuki glances briefly at Chihiro.
He eventually nods decisively.
Come on, say it.
Just spit it out.
Shota: "...Let me go."
Yusaku: "Huh?"
Shota: "I'll go to the site by myself."
Yusaku: "..."
I make an exaggerated surprised expression.
Then I look at him with a disgusted face.
Yusaku: "You're going to wipe your own ass?"
Shota: "Y-yes."
Yusaku: "What about your wife?"
Shota: "The section chief will take care of her instead of me..."
Yusaku: "You're joking, right?"
Shota: "That's the only way."
Yusaku: "Your wife will be disappointed when she wakes up."
Shota: "W-well, we are the ones who caused it, so if we explain the situation, she'll understand."
Yusaku: "But..."
Shota: "There's no more time. Please take care of Chihiro."
Yusaku: "..."
With those words, he looks back as if being pulled back by his heart.
Despite his haste, he keeps looking back.
He loves her, doesn't he?
The wife who came to my fingers.
Yusaku: "...Take care."
I mutter as if to myself, with a smirk on my face.
As you can see, there's no sign of station staff.
They haven't come once since they refused to call an ambulance.
Relief.
Yusaku: "..."
You never disappoint, do you?
Just as I imagined when I touched you.
The underwear is noticeably soaked.
The juice has seeped all the way down to her thighs.
It's good I didn't let her husband accompany her.
What would he think if he saw this?
Maybe he, being a simple guy...
He would misunderstand it as her wetting herself.
You wouldn't want that, would you?
I prevented that for you.
So, Madam...
Give me a reward.
After all, we're alone together.
Yusaku: "..."
My fingers move towards her attractive legs.
Initially, I stroke them, enjoying the feel of her stockings.
Her slender ankles.
Her well-fleshed calves.
Her thighs, as tight as her buttocks.
She truly has a flawless body.
But despite that, she's full of openings.
You might think you're armored.
But from my perspective, you're virtually naked.
It's surprising you've been safe up until now.
Have you been hiding in your husband's shadow, keeping your breath held?
To remain solely his.
But today is the end of that neat resolution.
In commemoration of the beginning, I'll get a direct look.
At your precious pussy.
Squish.
Yusaku: "..."
The rising heat.
The way it peels away from her wet crotch is lascivious.
But more than anything, the shape of her genitals surprises me.
There's no sign of her husband's touch.
Even the labia protruding from her slit is minimal.
The clitoris is almost entirely buried in the valley.
Without pubic hair, you'd mistake it for a child's.
Yet the surface is slick.
Even now, nectar is seeping from her vagina.
That contrast is incredibly stimulating.
The wife who came with such genitals.
Yusaku: "Ku...ha..."
I bring the middle finger that made her climax to my nose.
Chihiro's faint scent remains.
My penis throbs in my pants.
Such a wonderful smell.
Though the shape is childlike, it's proof that she's well matured.
Of course.
You're a married woman.
But don't you think it's unfair?
That he enjoys this smell more than I do.
Snap.
Chihiro: "..."
As vulgar as I can think of...
I make her pose like a frog on purpose.
A pose that doesn't befit a prim and proper wife.
It's so embarrassing that it's more for the viewer.
You've never shown this to your husband, have you?
This is my retaliation for you not treating me special.
Yusaku: "Kuha...ah..."
Suppressing my pounding heart, I put my hand in my chest pocket.
I point the lens of my cell phone at Chihiro first and foremost.
The most damaging material.
This is how the wife invites her own misfortune.
I won't let you deny it.
You're the one who fainted on your own.
Thanks to that, I can make more extreme demands.
I can't wait to take the pictures.
The moment when I show this picture to no one else but the wife herself.
Yusaku: "Kuku..."
I part her soft pubic hair.
I stage it so that her genitals are exposed as much as possible.
Even with her legs spread, her labia remain closed.
I poke at them with my fingertips, spreading them slightly.
The exposed mucous membrane.
Its color is sakura pink.
The sticky honey that clings to it is lascivious.
Click.
One photo is a full body shot.
The other is a close-up of the genital area.
The one without her face is my spoil of war.
Just her pussy alone isn't enough for blackmail material.
I put my phone back in my pocket.
I cover Chihiro as if we're about to have sex.
Our bodies are pressed together.
I can feel the wife's breath directly.
Mugyu.
Chihiro: "U..."
While holding her, I move my right hand to her breast.
I stroke it as if confirming its shape.
The mass of flesh stuffed tightly into her bra.
Because of that, I don't feel much softness.
Isn't the underwear a bit small?
It's unusual for a sensitive wife like her.
Feeling a strange discomfort, I put only my nose under her arm.
Smelling the scent here is a given.
That well-maintained area.
In the air-conditioning-less first aid room, sweat was trickling down.
Feeling a sense of regret, my mouth steadily moves downwards.
Passing her slim, tight waist.
Crossing the lewdly bulging mound of Venus.
Finally, I reach the wet hole.
Kuchu...
A kiss on her labia.
It's squishy and feels good.
The smell tickling my nose is excellent.
Of course, it's different from anything unclean.
It's the lingering scent particular to after climaxing.
The pheromones of a woman seeping from the core.
It's kind of exciting.
I want to thrust my dick in right now.
Such a lusciousness makes me think so.
Nice.
She's strongly asserting her femininity.
But isn't her body the exact opposite of ideal?
Can't be helped.
That duality is the wife herself.
No matter how wet her crotch gets, her sense of chastity is above average.
She must be uncomfortable even being seen by men other than her husband.
Thinking about it, the tight bra might be on purpose.
Large breasts.
Are you careful not to stand out as much as possible?
Is it some kind of trauma?
If so, you should let go and liberate yourself.
Kuchu...
Chihiro: "Nn...uh..."
I bring my tongue tip to her vaginal opening.
This time, I taste the love juice along with the scent.
The excitement is even greater if I think of it as the wife's juice.
My penis is already beyond an erect state.
I desperately resist the urge to masturbate.
It would be a waste to ejaculate and lose tension.
What shall I do next?
My imagination is ridiculously bloated.
When you want to enjoy greedily, that's just about right.
Chu... Pero...
Yusaku: "Ku..."
Delicious.
I'm totally smitten.
With the wife's pussy.
Chu... Chu... Pero... Pero...
Chihiro: "...?"
Yusaku: "Nfuh... Chu... Pero..."
Chihiro: "...??"
Yusaku: "Nfuh, nfuh... Kuchu... Nn... Haa..."
Chihiro: "...eh...eh...?"
Yusaku: "Nguh... Pecha... Nn... Nn..."
Chihiro: "No~~~~~~~~~~!!"
Dokan.
Yusaku: "!?"
Ouch.
I was so engrossed that I didn't notice.
I was kicked in the head so hard that my neck shrank while I was off guard.
Chihiro, still kicking her legs, is unbearable.
As a result, I roll off the bench seat.
Dosan.
Yusaku: "Ugeh..."
Just like that, the wife dashes outside.
She stumbles against the wall several times as she bolts from the infirmary.
She's unsteady on her feet, maybe her head is spinning again.
And yet she's forcibly at full speed.
She's moving with enough momentum that passersby have to avoid her.
...
Yusaku: "Haa, haa..."
Damn it.
Where did she go?
I look around.
I'm shielding my eyes from the sun with my hand, looking for a familiar figure.
It's really annoying.
And it's hot.
The cicadas are loud.
Yusaku: "Oh..."
There she is.
I found her without any trouble.
In front of the building where the cooking class is held.
Her earlier dash seems like a lie.
Probably her dull brain is back to normal.
As soon as she could grasp the situation, she became unable to move.
Chihiro, shrinking at the vulnerability of her lower body, stands frozen in front of the entrance.
Cute.
Her gesture of fidgeting and desperately pulling at her hem.
I think that stands out more though.
Yusaku: "...Hey."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "Are you done running?"
Chihiro: "My... my underwear."
Yusaku: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "Please give me back my underwear."
Yusaku: "I left it in the infirmary."
Chihiro: "Go... go and get it."
Yusaku: "You're just going to throw it away in the toilet, aren't you?"
Chihiro: "I will wear it today when I go home."
Yusaku: "...No."
Chihiro: "Why?"
Yusaku: "You're going home without panties."
Chihiro: "But... but..."
Yusaku: "Don't worry, I'll make sure to see you off."
Chihiro: "I don't want to be near you anymore."
Yusaku: "Oh really..."
Here we are in the middle of the street.
People naturally gather their gazes to the escalating voices.
To calm down Chihiro
To shout louder than Chihiro
Yusaku: "Everyone is watching me, huh?"
Chihiro: "...What do you mean?"
Yusaku: "You enjoy the thrill, don't you?"
Chihiro: "No, I don't enjoy that at all."
Yusaku: "Yet you're trying to attract attention, aren't you?"
Chihiro: "No, I'm not..."
Yusaku: "Don't hold back, let everyone see. The panty-less Mrs. Chihiro."
Chihiro: "Stop it..."
Yusaku: "Stop what?"
Chihiro: "Stop saying mean things."
Yusaku: "I'm not lying, am I?"
Yusaku: "Ladies and gentlemen passing by~!!"
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Yusaku: "I'm going to share a special secret with you."
Chihiro: "Wait..."
Yusaku: "This woman standing right here, she's not wearing any panties..."
Chihiro: "..."
Squeeze.
Yusaku: "Mmm..."
Chihiro hurries over in a fluster.
She suddenly covers my mouth.
Chihiro: "Please, be quiet."
Yusaku: "...Get your smelly hand off me."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yusaku: "You were the one who raised your voice first. You ruined my attempt to handle this quietly."
Chihiro: "I didn't mean to, I just..."
Yusaku: "You really want the attention, don't you?"
Chihiro: "No, it's just... the cooking school I'm attending is right there. If anyone I know hears this strange rumor..."
Yusaku: "I'm not lying."
Chihiro: "Even if that's true, there's no need to tell strangers..."
Yusaku: "Who gets to decide that, I wonder."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yusaku: "What do you think?"
Chihiro: "...Where is my husband?"
Yusaku: "Don't dodge the question."
Chihiro: "Please, tell me."
Yusaku: "Your answer comes first."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Answer me quickly."
Chihiro: "It's up to... you, Chief."
Yusaku: "You understand perfectly, don't you?"
Chihiro: "...I answered as you told me."
Yusaku: "So?"
Chihiro: "Now please tell me, what happened to my husband?"
Yusaku: "He left you here and went to do his inspection properly."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Was it a bit of a shock?"
Chihiro: "...It's work, it can't be helped."
Yusaku: "You're very understanding when it comes to your husband."
Chihiro: "But why are you the only one..."
Yusaku: "He asked me to. 'Please stay by her side,' he said."
Chihiro: "...So you manipulated my husband to make that happen."
Yusaku: "Listen here..."
Enough already
I'll lift your skirt if you get cheeky
Yusaku: "Enough already."
Yusaku: "If you get cheeky, I'll lift your skirt."
Chihiro: "Ah... no..."
Yusaku: "Is that how you speak to me, who accompanied you?"
Chihiro: "If we trace back the cause, it's because you did that to me..."
Yusaku: "...Oh really?"
I smirk.
As if to stoke Chihiro's anxiety, I deliberately look at her lower abdomen.
Yusaku: "Looks like this will attract even more attention."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yusaku: "Where should we start tracing back? From when you were molested?"
Chihiro: "I, I didn't mean that..."
Yusaku: "Explain to everyone how sinful my fingers were."
Chihiro: "I, I don't want to talk about that."
Yusaku: "Even though it felt so good you fainted."
Chihiro: "I, I just felt sick, that's all."
Yusaku: "Really?"
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "Then I have nothing to do with it."
Chihiro: "...That's unfair."
Yusaku: "You have the nerve to say that after blowing yourself up."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Make up your mind. Did you faint because it felt too good, or did you collapse because you felt sick?"
Chihiro: "I, I felt sick..."
Yusaku: "Then apologize to me."
Chihiro: "Why should I?"
Yusaku: "Who blamed me for your collapse?"
Chihiro: "That doesn't change the fact that you touched me."
Yusaku: "But you agreed to it. You accepted it without screaming, and now we're talking about why you fainted."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yusaku: "So you're going with 'it felt too good'?"
Chihiro: "There's no way it felt good."
Yusaku: "Then you'll have to apologize on your knees."
Chihiro: "No, I..."
Yusaku: "You disregarded my good intentions."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "What's wrong?"
Chihiro: "...Please, enough already."
Yusaku: "Absolutely."
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Yusaku: "I'll forgive you."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Surprised, aren't you?"
Chihiro: "...I'm a little taken aback."
Yusaku: "You should be saying thanks instead of being surprised."
Chihiro: "Thanks for what?"
Yusaku: "You're spared the embarrassment of talking about it here."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Say it quickly."
Chihiro: "Th-thank you..."
Yusaku: "Don't worry about it."
Chihiro: "..."
Things are completely on my terms now.
Chihiro must be totally confused.
She casually uttered an apology without thinking deeply.
But you know what?
That's what slowly changes her.
Yusaku: "Enough with the standing talk, let's go home together."
Chihiro: "I told you, I'm fine."
Yusaku: "What is?"
Chihiro: "I can go home by myself."
Yusaku: "As long as your husband asked me, I can't let that happen."
Chihiro: "That's because my husband doesn't know the circumstances..."
Yusaku: "..."
I still haven't deleted the photos
I should make some money
Yusaku: "I still haven't deleted the photos."
Chihiro: "I-I know that."
Yusaku: "If I don't need to send them, maybe I should make some money."
Chihiro: "What?"
Yusaku: "I'll sell your photos here. To me, you may be unattractive, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder."
Chihiro: "!?"
Yusaku: "It's fine as long as they're not acquaintances, right?"
Chihiro: "That's not the issue!"
Yusaku: "Then start walking towards the station obediently. Of course, don't pull at the hem of your skirt, just walk normally."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yusaku: "What's the matter?"
Chihiro: "Can you promise not to touch me on the train?"
Yusaku: "Yeah."
Chihiro: "And, can I sit somewhere away from you?"
Yusaku: "...Get going already."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I make a motion as if to lift her skirt.
She must have thought I was serious.
Chihiro begins to walk hastily, her face contorting.
I follow a short distance behind.
I observe her squirming in embarrassment.
Her fingers reach for the hem of her skirt over and over again.
Each time, her buttocks tighten.
Look.
The stairs are just a bit further.
I won't let it slide if you use your bag to cover your ass.
Chihiro: "..."
That's good.
She's sticking to my orders perfectly, isn't she?
I can see the shape of her ass more clearly than before.
The hem of her skirt just barely covers the root of her thighs.
Her bare legs make it feel even more indecent.
She's probably walking desperately.
Trying as much as possible not to think about anything, just looking straight ahead.
Thanks to that, her embarrassment just keeps piling up.
It's like she's being violated by the very air, isn't it?
Yusaku: "..."
I take a break midway up the stairs.
Pretending to tie my shoelaces, I just raise my gaze.
Madam.
I might be able to see from here.
The naïve shape of her pussy from the gap of her peachy ass.
Yusaku: "Hngh..."
My penis stirring in my pants.
Today, my pants are stiff with arousal.
But it's okay.
I've thought about where to drop it.
The ultimate masturbation that I couldn't achieve last night.
This time I'll finish in the way I want.
...
Clack, thump, clack, thump...
Chihiro: "..."
What's wrong?
Look at me for a bit.
Chihiro, obediently sitting in her seat.
She reluctantly complies, under the condition that I don't approach.
I'm keeping my promise, right?
I'm sitting in the position you hate the most.
The look on Chihiro's face when she sat facing me.
It was full of disgust.
She bites her lip at the reason her bag was taken.
With a bitter expression, she holds down the front of her skirt.
But she's oddly reserved.
Only applying enough strength to barely hide it.
I'm not exactly doing this as a service.
It just happens unconsciously.
If she defiantly guards herself, she doesn't know what else will happen.
That fear weakens the force in her hand.
Yusaku: "Heh..."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Chihiro, forced to respond to slight changes.
She's not looking, but all her nerves are focused on me.
It's okay.
The important part is hidden.
For now.
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Yawn..."
Chihiro: "..."
Yawning, I strike the same pose as Chihiro.
Our eyes meet, and I give her a lewd smirk.
I pointedly point to my own legs.
I slowly spread the knees that were politely closed.
I send a sign with my eyes, as if to tell her to imitate me.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Look.
Try doing the same.
You can do it, right?
As you can see, the car is empty.
No one but me is watching.
Chihiro: "..."
Chihiro seems to be determined to ignore me.
Well, I thought she'd do that at first.
I slowly put my hand in my pocket.
I pull out something that shouldn't be there.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
It's no surprise she's shocked.
What I've pulled out is the tip of a stocking.
It's a lie that I left it at the first aid station.
There's no way I'd waste it like that.
What will you do?
If I keep pulling like this, your underwear will come out too.
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Huh..."
I see.
You still can't make yourself look vulgar?
If you open your knees, your pussy will be in full view.
At least from my position.
That's why I want to make you do it.
Just like when you were molested in front of your husband...
I want you to feel as embarrassed as back then.
Plop.
Chihiro: "Ah, no..."
I told you so.
Finally, it's come out of my pocket.
Madam's underwear, with a lewd stain.
Just touching it tells me where the private part is, it's that stiff.
I don't care about the public gaze, I bring it to my nose.
Stretching the thin cloth, I begin to observe it so closely that it could tear.
Chihiro: "..."
What do you think will happen if I leave it like this?
The level of what I'm going to do will keep rising.
Should I present it to the old man in the corner?
Chihiro: "Ah..."
My gaze, as if looking for someone.
Chihiro, in a hurry.
She understands perfectly well without words.
What happens next depends on you.
I meet her gaze, as if forcing a decision.
If you fulfill my wish, I'll give it back.
You're used to opening your legs under the table, right?
Chihiro: "..."
As expected of Madam.
Even if she's about to give a blowjob.
Even if she's about to climax on a train.
Even if I'm about to lick her pussy.
She still doesn't abandon her original self.
Is the face of her husband floating in her mind?
I suppose so.
That guy's always the straw she clings to.
Yusaku: "Hmph..."
I'm about to get up any moment.
Chihiro is flustered by that atmosphere.
She's shaking her head vigorously.
Is she stupid?
There's no way I'd back down because of that.
She should know that better than anyone.
Chihiro: "St, stop..."
It's when I lift my hips from the seat.
A voice like a mosquito's buzz from your mouth.
Chihiro: "St, stop... please..."
Yusaku: "What?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "I'm going to tell the old man that it's Madam's underwear."
Chihiro: "Pl, please sit down."
Yusaku: "..."
Very well.
But this is your last chance.
I deliberately sit shallowly.
I lowered my gaze as much as possible.
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
What's wrong?
Hang in there.
Just straining won't open your knees.
Chihiro: "Ah... uh..."
Yusaku: "..."
That's good.
The angle is shallow, but it's excellent.
It probably took as much courage as jumping off a building.
Thanks to that, I can see it clearly.
Madam's pussy.
Just keep looking without doing anything
Deliberately let out a big yawn
Yusaku: "Yaaawwwn..."
Chihiro: "Ah, no..."
I let out a deliberate yawn.
Trying to direct the gaze of the distant old man towards us.
Chihiro's face is redder than ever.
As if she had drunk red ink, even the tips of her ears were flushed.
Chihiro: "Hic... uh... uh..."
Isn't that cute?
Her body is shaking slightly.
Just like when I was molesting her.
She seems about to faint from embarrassment alone.
In a sense, it's an act more immoral than sex.
That again causes a change in Madam.
Be careful not to stain your skirt.
The lining part right underneath.
Something lewd is starting to mark there.
Chihiro: "Uh... uh..."
Not yet.
Stay that way until we get to the station.
I won't allow you to close your legs.
Madam is that attractive right now.
So much so that it feels wasteful to watch alone.
At least I want to show it to her husband.
Her currently perfectly clear self.
Enjoying the view of your pussy with him.
Just thinking about it gives me a thrill.
Yusaku: "..."
My face grins at the pitch-black idea.
Probably the most wicked face I've made today.
Poor Madam.
She doesn't notice anything because her eyes are closed.
The current misfortune is just the beginning.
The time to realize that might be coming soon...
...
