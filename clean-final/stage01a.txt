...The next day, 8 PM...
Yuusaku: "You live in quite a nice place, huh."
Shouta: "You're too kind."
Yuusaku: "...What floor?"
Shouta: "Uh, room 303..."
Yuusaku: "I asked you what floor it is."
Shouta: "Th-third floor."
Yuusaku: "So, you're telling me to press the elevator button?"
Shouta: "Ah, sorry."
...
*Ding*... *Whoosh*...
Yuusaku: "Hmm..."
The view opens up abruptly as they exit the elevator.
Surrounded by a quiet residential area.
Perhaps due to the first floor being a shop, the courtyard is a wide parking lot.
Yuusaku: "Press the doorbell quickly."
Shouta: "Y-yes."
*Ding-dong*.
Chihiro: "Yes?"
Yuusaku: "..."
Now, it's time for the entry of the homely but skilled cook.
It could be a horror show.
Chihiro: "Welcome."
Yuusaku: "..."
I'm speechless.
To put it bluntly, I'm surprised.
No, surprised doesn't cut it.
Her eyes and nose are very prominent.
She could even rival a certain famous female announcer.
Chihiro: "My husband is always in your care."
The woman bows deeply.
Suddenly, a view of her cleavage.
Her breasts are also large.
Yuusaku: "Sorry to bother you at this hour, ma'am."
Chihiro: "Not at all."
Yuusaku: "..."
This is a problem.
She smiles like an angel.
Chihiro: "Thank you for coming today. I'll prepare the meal right away, so please make yourself comfortable until then."
She bows again, revealing her cleavage.
After that, she walks away.
Her slippers making a soft sound.
Everything about her movements is perfect.
And yet, there's a strange stiffness.
What is this unease?
Is she nervous because I'm her superior?
Shouta: "Um, boss...shall we have a beer first...?"
Yuusaku: "...Hey."
Shouta: "Y-yes?"
Yuusaku: "How did you deceive her?"
Shouta: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "I'm talking about your beautiful wife."
Shouta: "De-deceive, that's... a bad way to put it..."
Yuusaku: "Hmph..."
Well, whatever.
I stride into the room.
A clean living room, well-taken care of.
Two cold beers are on the table, just out of the fridge.
There are even stylish hors d'oeuvres lined up.
Damn it.
This warm home...
It's perfectly prepared to welcome a superior.
I feel like destroying it right now.
I'm pretty hungry, you know.
Stop trying to act cool and bring out a bowl dish or something already.
...
Yuusaku: "..."
About 20 minutes into the meal.
As you can see, the conversation isn't exactly flowing.
I've only made a few jokes, right after picking up my chopsticks.
About this year being unusually hot.
About the abnormal number of cicadas due to the heat.
Besides that, I've left the nervous couple alone.
I focused solely on eating.
Shouta: "Uh..."
Chihiro: "Um..."
The wife looks at me timidly.
Why am I sitting directly across from her?
It's not appetizing to eat while looking at a guy's face.
So, I just moved my seat on my own.
Just from that, the small-minded husband shrinks back, thinking he's made a faux pas.
And the wife is just confused, not knowing why.
Chihiro: "...Is it to your liking?"
Yuusaku: "..."
It's not, right?
You're good at cooking, Madam
Yuusaku: "It's not."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Shouta: "No, um..."
Chihiro: "I-I'm sorry. By the next time you come, I'll study your preferences."
Yuusaku: "..."
Are you surprised by the unexpected answer?
Truth is, it's so delicious it could make your cheeks melt.
I just felt like being a bit mean.
Looking around, there's nothing but labor-intensive dishes.
She probably started preparing them this morning.
A young wife who devotes herself for her husband, huh?
Well, do your best until I leave.
Yuusaku: "You're good at cooking, ma'am."
Chihiro: "Ah, thank you."
Shouta: "Please, eat as much as you like, boss."
Yuusaku: "You seem to be good at other things as well, right?"
Chihiro: "Eh?"
Shouta: "???"
Yuusaku: "You know, those things other than cooking."
Chihiro: "Th-those things?"
Shouta: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "(Hmm...)"
What are they thinking?
The couple exchanges glances.
Yuusaku: "Like cleaning and laundry, for example."
Chihiro: "Ah... no, I'm not especially good at... those things."
Yuusaku: "But you seem to be organized, don't you?"
Chihiro: "I've always loved cooking."
Yuusaku: "So, you like big, thick radishes?"
Chihiro: "Bi-big radishes?"
Yuusaku: "Not just any radish, the big, thick ones."
Chihiro: "...Big... thick... radish."
Shouta: "..."
Again, the couple exchange glances.
I understand about the wife, but Mr. Akizuki.
You're joining in the confusion as well.
This level of teasing is commonplace in the office.
It's not like we've just met yesterday or today.
Chihiro: "...I often use them in miso soup."
Yuusaku: "The thick ones?"
Chihiro: "We-well, to an extent."
Yuusaku: "What about thick cucumbers?"
Shouta: "I-I like to use them in pickles."
Yuusaku: "...I was asking your wife, though."
Shouta: "I-I'm sorry."
Chihiro: "I... It's my fault for not answering right away... I'm sorry..."
Yuusaku: "..."
Their lovey-dovey act is making the food taste stale.
The husband trying to protect his cute new wife.
The young wife trying to support her husband.
I don't like it.
Will it ruin the enjoyable meal if I don't do this?
Yuusaku: "By the way..."
Shouta and Chihiro: "Y-Yes."
How did the two of you meet?
You got married about half a year ago?
Any plans for children?
Yuusaku: "How did the two of you meet?"
Chihiro: "Well..."
Again, the two of them look at each other.
They're trying to figure out who should answer.
Yuusaku: "Please let the wife answer the more romantic stories."
Chihiro: "Ah, okay... then..."
She clears her throat while nodding.
Her elegant mouth is cute.
They say that when you purse your lips, it looks like a vagina.
I wonder if your wife has a pussy like that.
Chihiro: "My husband and I were classmates up to middle school."
Yuusaku: "Really..."
Chihiro: "Our houses were quite close... right, dear?"
Shouta: "Y-Yeah."
Yuusaku: "But that alone wouldn't lead to marriage, would it?"
Chihiro: "Y-Yes... When I happened to return home, my husband was also at his parents' house... This was about five years ago."
Yuusaku: "So, you met by chance, again."
Chihiro: "Until I went to university in Tokyo, we would occasionally see each other in town. But by that time we were only exchanging greetings..."
Yuusaku: "Didn't Mr. Akizuki also go to a university in Tokyo?"
Shouta: "I-I'm a year younger. So, Chihiro went to Tokyo a year earlier."
Chihiro: "Even though we were in Tokyo, we didn't know where each other lived. And we weren't close enough to keep in touch at that time..."
Yuusaku: "I see, right."
So, she's an older wife, then.
Akizuki is 24, if I recall correctly.
Which means this woman is 25.
That's 10 years younger than me.
Maybe because her face is youthful, she doesn't look her age.
Perhaps she could pass for just over 20?
Yuusaku: "Akizuki-kun."
Shouta: "Y-Yes."
Yuusaku: "How did you manage to seduce such a beautiful wife?"
Shouta: "N-No, well..."
Yuusaku: "Tell me honestly."
Chihiro: "Actually, I was the one who..."
Yuusaku: "Huh?"
The young wife's cheeks are faintly cherry-colored.
She's really blushing.
Chihiro: "I invited my husband to the summer festival when I returned home. Even though four years had passed since I moved to Tokyo, Shouta-chan hadn't changed at all..."
Shouta-chan.
At those words, she hastily covers her mouth.
Chihiro: "I-I'm sorry."
Yuusaku: "It's fine to call him Shouta-chan... right, city hall worker Shouta-chan?"
Shouta: "...P-Please, chief."
Chihiro: "Anyway, I was moved by my husband's simplicity. I thought it was rare to find a man who hadn't been corrupted by the world around him, who didn't pretend to be something he's not..."
Yuusaku: "..."
A picture-perfect love story.
I like it even less.
Makes me want to jump in a time machine and wreck it.
Yuusaku: "So, you started dating and ended up getting married... right?"
Chihiro: "Yes, if we trace it back, it all started with a chance encounter."
Yuusaku: "What else?"
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "Reasons for getting married, other than his simplicity."
Chihiro: "His kindness and other things..."
Yuusaku: "How about the size of his tool?"
Chihiro: "...Tool?"
Shouta: "Chief..."
Yuusaku: "...What?"
Shouta: "N-No... that kind of talk is a bit..."
Yuusaku: "It's night, so it doesn't matter."
Shouta: "I-I don't think it's about the time of day..."
Yuusaku: "..."
Hmmm.
For the timid Mr. Akizuki, he's putting up quite a fight.
I see.
You can't stand to see your precious wife being embarrassed, can you?
You're just as head over heels in love as your wife, aren't you?
I get it.
Mr. Akizuki, with the small penis I saw on the company trip...
I'll end this conversation out of respect for your desperate face.
Yuusaku: "By the way, Madam..."
Chihiro: "Y-Yes."
Yuusaku: "I'll ask you this while I'm at it, Madam."
Chihiro: "Y-Yes."
Yuusaku: "You've been married for about half a year now?"
Shouta: "N-no, it's been a year and... a bit..."
Yuusaku: "Oh, has it already been that long?"
Shouta: "We had our ceremony last June..."
Yuusaku: "I forgot since I wasn't invited."
Shouta: "..."
The two exchange uneasy glances.
The sudden blow probably made the food stick in their throats.
Shouta: "We went back to the countryside and had a small ceremony with just our families... I thought we already told you..."
Yuusaku: "But you did have a reception after coming back here, right?"
Shouta: "N-not a reception, we just invited some friends..."
Yuusaku: "Was that so, ma'am?"
Chihiro: "...Eh?"
Surprised to suddenly be included in the conversation.
It's not that she was spaced out.
She was so worried about her husband, who was being attacked, that she lost track of me.
She likes him that much, huh?
With her looks, she could have picked any man.
Why Shouta, eh?
Yuusaku: "So you just invited friends to show off?"
Chihiro: "Y-yes, that's correct."
Yuusaku: "Well, can't be helped, right? Right, Shouta-kun?"
Shouta: "..."
Yuusaku: "By the way, ma'am..."
Chihiro: "Y-yes?"
Yuusaku: "While I'm asking, ma'am..."
Chihiro: "Y-yes?"
Yuusaku: "Any plans for children?"
Shouta: "S-section chief."
Yuusaku: "These days, men also take parental leave, you know. As your boss, I need to have some vague idea."
Shouta: "She's a housewife... I won't be taking parental leave."
Yuusaku: "...You dislike being asked so much?"
Shouta: "N-no, but..."
Chihiro: "We don't have any plans at the moment."
Shouta: "..."
The woman looks at me and gives a little smile.
A perfectly timed lifeboat.
Sensitively detecting the approaching bad atmosphere.
Quite quick on the uptake.
In contrast to her stiff husband.
Honestly, he's being outdone by his wife.
Yuusaku: "By the way, ma'am..."
Chihiro: "Y-yes?"
Yuusaku: "While I'm asking, ma'am..."
Chihiro: "Y-yes?"
Yuusaku: "Hmmm..."
I drained the beer remaining in my glass.
It's been exactly an hour since we sat down.
Even with the air conditioning, I'm already sweaty.
But the real surprise came after.
She didn't miss my slightly displeased expression.
Chihiro: "I'm sorry for not noticing earlier. I'll bring a fresh beer."
With that, the woman rose from her seat.
The left-behind husband...
He is desperately trying to keep the conversation going.
He doesn't need to say anything.
His conversation would be boring anyway.
Yuusaku: "No need to worry."
Using that phrase as a pretext, I observe the young wife's buttocks.
They're quite plump and nice.
Also, her slim waist that tapers off is tantalizing.
Oh my.
I can't believe it more and more.
Is this fool holding such a fine woman every night?
Pearls before swine.
Gold coins to a cat.
Derisive words come to mind one after another.
Chihiro: "...Sorry to keep you waiting."
Yuusaku: "Then let's make this the last one."
Chihiro: "Please take your time."
Yuusaku: "..."
Of course, I'm not taking it seriously.
It's just a common social courtesy towards her husband's boss.
Yuusaku: "I have work tomorrow."
I gulp down the chilled beer in one go.
After that, it's trivial small talk.
I also stopped spewing venom.
Why?
Because I've become interested for various reasons.
Sarcastic words are already pointless.
Yes, that's right.
I'm trying to take back a more substantial souvenir.
…
Chihiro: "..."
Chihiro: "...Hoo."
A small sigh.
The dinner meeting is finally over.
I'm starting to clean up in the kitchen.
My husband is face down at the table.
He's completely exhausted and not moving.
He might even be asleep.
But I can't let my guard down yet.
Because the section chief is in the bathroom.
He said he wanted to sober up before he went home.
Apparently, washing your face makes you feel refreshed.
Chihiro: "...Hoo."
Once again, a small sigh.
It seems unlikely that I'll forget about tonight for a while.
I didn't think he was such a different person.
I feel like I caught a glimpse of my husband's hardships.
He's probably not a bad person.
Generously described as individualistic.
Badly described as nonsensical.
Even his gaze is sharp.
He seems like he wouldn't tolerate any mistakes, even outside of work.
He seems very particular about hierarchical relationships.
So I have to be careful too.
Summer gifts, end-of-year gifts, New Year's cards.
Supporting my husband by sending them without fail.
That's about all I can do.
Yuusaku: "Ma'am."
Chihiro: "...?"
The section chief's voice came from beyond the door.
It startled me quite a bit.
Chihiro: "Y-Yes."
Yuusaku: "Could you lend me a large towel?"
Chihiro: "...Is something wrong?"
Yuusaku: "I got my pants wet when I was washing my face."
Chihiro: "P-Please use the bath towel on the shelf."
Yuusaku: "...Which shelf?"
Chihiro: "The single-door next to the washbasin is..."
I stopped talking mid-sentence.
That won't do.
Various things are stored there.
I think there are also stocks of menstrual products.
Chihiro: "W-Wait a moment, please."
I was in quite a flurry.
I rushed to the bathroom.
Chihiro: "!"
Yuusaku: "Oh my."
Chihiro: "Ah… uh…"
Yuusaku: "You should at least knock, ma'am."
Chihiro: "I-I'm sorry!"
SLAM!!
Chihiro: "Haah… haah…"
My heart feels like it's about to leap out of my mouth.
What was that?
Why did he have his underwear down?
His dangling penis.
It was grotesquely large.
Chihiro: "..."
I feel so disgusted I'm about to vomit.
I glanced at the table.
My husband is still face down.
He has no idea what happened.
Yuusaku: "..."
Chihiro: "Ah…"
Yuusaku: "...I apologize."
Chihiro: "N-No, I'm the one who should...I'm sorry…"
Yuusaku: "I ended up getting my pants soaking wet. I couldn't react because you opened the door without any warning."
Chihiro: "…I'm truly sorry."
His overly polite language made me feel even more awkward.
I'm still flustered.
I keep apologizing, but I can't think of anything clever to say.
Yuusaku: "Well, it's force majeure. Let's both forget about it."
As he said this, the section chief's gaze shifted to my husband.
Yuusaku: "...Did you see it?"
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "My penis."
Chihiro: "..."
Why would he ask such a thing?
I'm done for.
I can only bow my head in embarrassment.
I even feel like he's deliberately teasing me.
Yuusaku: "Akizuki-kun really can't handle his drink, can he?"
Chihiro: "I don't think he drank that much...he's not usually good with alcohol..."
Yuusaku: "Please make sure to tell him not to be late tomorrow."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
That's not good.
I need to see him out properly.
Chihiro: "I-I'll wake my husband."
Yuusaku: "Let's leave him be."
Chihiro: "I'll be scolded later."
Yuusaku: "Feel free to be scolded at your discretion."
Chihiro: "..."
Yuusaku: "Well then, ma'am, thank you for the meal."
Chihiro: "I-I couldn't do anything for you..."
Yuusaku: "Not at all."
The section chief stared at my face.
His eyes were somewhat snake-like.
I forced a smile and tried my best to respond.
If I looked away now, it would only worsen the impression.
Yuusaku: "...Good night."
Chihiro: "G-Good night. Please take care."
...Click... slam...
Chihiro: "..."
I collapsed in a heap right there.
I couldn't muster any strength.
Shou-chan.
I tried my best in my own way.
So, hold me later.
Hold me tightly.
...
......
