...The same day, 4pm...
Heavy footsteps.
Unstoppable sighs.
I shrink myself.
Hoping to meet no one.
Trudging up the corner of the stairs.
â€¦
Chihiro: "..."
Chihiro: "...huh."
Shota: "..."
Chihiro: "Oh..."
Shota: "Wh...where were you?"
Chihiro: "So...sorry... I was out..."
Shota: "I tried to call your cell phone many times."
Chihiro: "I, I turned it off on the train and forgot about it..."
Shota: "...was it the hospital, by any chance?"
Chihiro: "Som...somewhere like that."
Shota: "They're open even on Sundays."
Chihiro: "Yes..."
It's impossible.
I can't look at Shota's face properly.
The guilt of not having the ring.
That strangely stole my composure.
Chihiro: "...can I take a shower?"
Shota: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "Oh, it was hot and I sweat..."
Shota: "It's weird to ask every time. You always do that after going out, Chihiro."
Chihiro: "Ri...right."
Shota: "Maybe I'll join you."
Chihiro: "What?"
Shota: "Is that a problem?"
Chihiro: "...in broad daylight, both of us?"
Shota: "It feels like a typical Sunday, doesn't it?"
Chihiro: "Sho...Shota, you're acting strange."
If it were the old me, I would have been happy with this invitation.
But now I don't feel like it at all.
The body that was played with by that devil.
I hated the thought of him seeing me in my still dirty state.
Shota: "I have something to talk about, too..."
Chihiro: "..."
I have a hunch what it is.
Probably about the day after tomorrow.
Chihiro: "If there's something to talk about, I want to hear it first."
Shota: "We'll talk in the shower."
Chihiro: "Can we...not do it right now, but maybe at night?"
Shota: "The shower?"
Chihiro: "Ye...yes."
Shota: "...I see."
Chihiro: "..."
Shota looks a little puzzled.
It's painful that I seem to be avoiding taking a bath together.
Chihiro: "...what's the talk about?"
Shota: "Actually, when I met with the section chief..."
Chihiro: "..."
Shota's tone is hesitant.
That devil invited him to the pool.
That it's also a form of entertainment.
That he said he wanted Chihiro to come along too.
As I had guessed, I sighed inside at the contents.
Chihiro: "...of course I'll go with you."
Shota: "R...really? Are you sure?"
Chihiro: "After all, it's an important job for you, Shota."
Shota: "But, you know..."
Chihiro: "Don't worry, I'll be fine."
Shota: "..."
Even though he is still muttering to himself...
I understand why.
He knows that I don't like pools.
The last time I wore a swimsuit was, indeed, on our honeymoon.
Even with Shota, it was only that one time.
Shota: "...I appreciate it."
Chihiro: "I'm just doing my duty as a wife."
Shota: "Th-thank you."
Chihiro: "..."
Wife.
That word made my ring finger feel a bit cold.
Just a ring of metal.
No matter how much I try to convince myself, it's no use.
The feeling of being halved doesn't go away.
Shota: "Um..."
Chihiro: "Yes?"
Shota: "Can I ask one more thing?"
Chihiro: "..."
An uneasy premonition.
Shota: "When I went to the section chief's room..."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
My heart clenches.
Shota: "There was a cardboard box in the closet. It seemed to contain a doll, but now that I think about it, no matter how you look at it..."
Chihiro: "No matter how you look at it?"
Shota: "I think it might have contained a real woman."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
This is bad.
A stricken expression.
A rigid body.
I need to act more surprised.
Chihiro: "I, I don't quite understand what you're saying..."
Shota: "...Right."
Shota seems to be uncertain about whether he should have said this.
Because of that, his explanation becomes quieter and quieter.
To be honest, I couldn't hear everything he said.
But I pretended to be surprised and nodded along.
That way, I was able to keep up appearances.
Shota: "...What do you think?"
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Shota: "It's dangerous if it really contained a human, right?"
Chihiro: "...Why did you think it was a real person?"
Shota: "Ah... no... that's..."
Chihiro: "..."
Even though I couldn't hear everything, I could at least understand the gist of the story.
Shota did not mention the hole where my private parts were exposed.
Normally, I should have felt relieved.
But for some reason, I felt uneasy.
He may not tell me everything after all.
Chihiro: "...You didn't look inside, did you?"
Shota: "But when I kicked it, I heard a voice..."
Chihiro: "...What kind of voice?"
Shota: "A creepy moan."
Chihiro: "..."
A creepy moan.
That hurts a bit.
But I can't just say, "That was me."
Shota: "If it becomes a big deal later, my position would be awkward. Like if the person inside decided to sue..."
Chihiro: "..."
If you're that worried
He must be messing with you
Chihiro: "If you're that worried..."
Shota: "Yeah, yeah."
Chihiro: "..."
I ran my finger over the place where the ring was.
Something I hadn't thought about until I came back here.
While looking at Shota's face, that switch suddenly flipped.
Chihiro: "...We should probably do something about it."
Shota: "What do you mean by that?"
Chihiro: "Like reporting it to the police."
Shota: "What?!"
Chihiro: "..."
This is fine.
I won't regret it.
I don't want to continue lying.
Chihiro: "I'll go with you."
Shota: "Where to?"
Chihiro: "...Like I said, to the police."
Shota: "W-wait a minute..."
Chihiro: "The sooner, the better. Actually, there's something I want to talk about, too."
I said, smiling for some reason.
I was surprisingly calm, even to myself.
I revealed my left hand that I had been hiding behind.
The burden I had been carrying seemed to have vanished like a lie.
Of course, it's not going to be that easy.
I may never see Shota's smile again.
Voluntary questioning at the police.
It will be embarrassing, maybe even painfully so.
But the fact that there's still a chance to turn back is a relief.
It's now or never.
The last chance I have to be myself.
If I miss this, it's truly over...
...
...
...
We should probably do something about it.
That's what I really wanted to say.
But I don't have the courage to say it out loud.
Chihiro: "..."
Let's stop.
All my previous endurance would be wasted.
Chihiro: "He must be messing with you, surely."
Shota: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "I don't know much about it, but he seems like the type to do that."
Shota: "Well... that's true..."
Chihiro: "If he was really up to something strange, I don't think he would show it to you."
Shota: "...I see."
Chihiro: "It might even be a sign that things are going well."
Shota: "You mean between me and the section chief?"
Chihiro: "Yeah..."
Shota: "There's definitely less of the stuff that used to happen."
Chihiro: "Now, he relies on you too, right?"
Shota: "I think it's a mutual dependence, but I am indebted to him in many ways. The reception the day after tomorrow also seems to be half for my sake."
Chihiro: "...I see."
Shota: "If you owe them, they will always come back, he said."
Chihiro: "..."
I smile weakly.
I have no other way to mask my emotions.
Chihiro: "...I'll go change."
Leaving Shota, I head to the Japanese-style room alone.
Being by his side was somehow painful.
My soiled body will have to wait until night.
If I bring my nose close, I can probably smell the devil's scent.
Chihiro: "..."
I decide not to change into a skirt.
It's better to keep as much skin hidden as possible.
While paying attention to the closed sliding door,
I hurriedly change my underwear.
Only then do I finally take a sigh of relief.
Next is where to store the paper bag in my bag.
Of course, it contains that swimsuit.
A piece of cloth that barely covers the essentials.
If I wear that, even my pubic hair would peek out.
And not to mention the tips of my breasts...
I shudder.
Chihiro: "..."
Suddenly, my lower abdomen quivers.
A jolt of electricity runs from the base of my thighs to my brain.
Chihiro: "Ah... ah...!"
My waist involuntarily drops, and I'm in a position as if I'm about to pee.
The underwear I just changed into digs deep between my slit.
Chihiro: "Uh...!"
Wait a minute.
This can't be happening.
I feel like I'm going to climax.
Just standing here.
Without anyone doing anything strange to me.
Chihiro: "Ah... ah...!"
I hurriedly cover my mouth.
Still, a whimper leaks out.
The only thing separating us is a single sliding door.
If I make a strange noise, he'll definitely hear.
Shota.
Don't come in.
Just this once is enough.
Please don't come here...
...
...
...
...Same day, 11 p.m...
A soft squeeze.
Chihiro: "Ah...!"
A squeeze... a squelch.
Chihiro: "Uh..."
It's been six hours since then.
My lower abdomen has been buzzing all this time.
Chihiro: "Mm..."
This is the spot.
When I touch this part, I feel like I'm about to climax.
Why can't I resist?
Why do I climax so easily when I'm touched by someone I hate so much?
Has my body changed because I'm pregnant?
Or has it always been like this?
Squelch... uh...
Chihiro: "...haa... haa... mm... haa..."
At least the latter is not the case.
I've never doubled over for no reason in the past.
I've never felt like I was about to climax without even touching myself.
All of these are new experiences.
The initial discomfort I felt.
The abnormal wetness I became aware of when I was molested.
But now, I've gone beyond that.
I'm not just leaving traces on my underwear anymore.
I shiver, a heavy numbness causing my knees to shake.
Against my will, I find myself crouching down.
This is it.
This is what's wrong.
This little nub of flesh.
It's truly detestable.
Squelch... throb...
Chihiro: "Uh... ah... haa... haa... haa... ah..."
Throb... throb... squeeze... squelch...
Chihiro: "Mm... haa... mm... haa... haa... mm... ah... ah..."
I have to do something.
I need to understand my own body better.
I can't even walk outside with this anxiety.
Squelch... twitch...
Chihiro: "Ah...!"
It's about to happen.
A small climax.
I stop both my breath and the movement of my finger at the same time.
I put a lot of effort into my body.
Resisting the urge to climax.
The sweet, tingling sensation disperses.
It slowly seeps into my belly.
Chihiro: "Uh... ah..."
It's okay.
I haven't made a loud sound.
Shota went to bed early today as well.
I wanted him to hold me, but it was impossible with his considerate behavior.
He's been too kind to me since I told him about the pregnancy.
As if he were touching thin glass.
There was no atmosphere for sex.
Squelch... drip...
Chihiro: "Uh..."
I start moving my finger again.
Something hot and sticky drips from inside me.
Because of that, the sounds become even more indecent.
Squelch, squelch, squelch...
Chihiro: "Mm...!"
It's amazing.
If I hadn't kept the shower running, my wrist would surely be slick.
Squelch... twitch...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
This is bad.
The signs are coming back quickly.
And they're bigger than before.
My body, which I can't control at all.
But there's one thing I've learned.
Yes.
The pleasure builds up in proportion to the amount of restraint.
When I feel like I'm about to climax, I loosen my grip.
I've been repeating this since earlier.
Squelch... squelch... twitch...
Chihiro: "Uh... ah... haa..."
Squelch... throb... squelch... squelch...
Chihiro: "Ah... Uh... haa... ah... ah..."
Again, it's coming.
My twitching sex.
The entrance of my vagina is pecking at the finger between my labia.
It's somewhat lewd.
What will happen if I continue like this?
Will it feel really good?
Chihiro: "Uh... ah..."
Stop it, Chihiro.
Don't try something stupid.
I don't intend to masturbate.
I just wanted to know a little bit about myself.
My body is uncontrollable...
I should have already understood that.
So, I need to stop moving my finger.
Squelch... squelch... throb...
Chihiro: "Ah... ah..."
But I can't stop.
Why?
What should I do, Shota?
The brakes aren't working.
Squelch... squelch... throb... squelch... throb...
Chihiro: "Ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah..."
Jerk.
Chihiro: "I'm... I'm coming..."
Jerk, jerk...
Chihiro: "I'm gonna come... Shota..."
Tighten... squeeze... squeeze...
Chihiro: "~~~~~~~~~!!"
Twitch, twitch... twitch...
Chihiro: "Ah, ha... ha... ha... ha... ah..."
Just as I thought.
It feels much better than when I did it yesterday.
I'm surprised that I could go this far.
But for some reason, it's no match for the devil's tongue.
At best, it's about half as good.
Squeeze... twitch... jerk...
Chihiro: "Ah... ah... haa... ah..."
My privates are twitching more and more.
The entrance of my vagina that was pecking earlier is now sucking.
More, more.
It seems like it's begging for more.
I'm confused by the lustful writhing.
Even though I don't want anything.
I can endure without having sex.
I hate penises anyway.
To say more, I hate men.
I hate being touched, and of course, being watched.
The only exception is Shota.
So please.
I don't care who it is.
Create a miracle so I don't have to wear that swimsuit.
Being humiliated is better than being exposed.
Being tortured for not obeying is still better...
