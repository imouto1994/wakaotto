...And then, on the night of the second day of the consecutive holidays...
Yuusaku: "...Good evening."
Chihiro: "G-Good evening..."
Yuusaku: "..."
Don't be so nervous.
It's 12:30 a.m.
Meeting this late at night is all according to plan.
Of course, I won't make any blunders that would alert him.
Yuusaku: "Where's your husband?"
Chihiro: "He went to the open-air bath first..."
Yuusaku: "You're a bad wife for driving him off."
Chihiro: "I-I didn't drive him off."
Yuusaku: "Is that so?"
Chihiro: "H-He said he would check if there was anyone there first, and if I didn't come back in 10 minutes, Chihiro should come too..."
Yuusaku: "The prompt for that was my text message, right?"
Chihiro: "N-no, the idea of going late at night was discussed with him since noon."
Yuusaku: "...Don't get so defensive."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yuusaku: "Was dinner good?"
Chihiro: "Y-Yes."
Yuusaku: "How was it sitting face-to-face with your husband?"
Chihiro: "E-even if you ask me what it was like..."
Yuusaku: "A couple without a third wheel is happy, isn't it?"
Chihiro: "That's not necessarily..."
Yuusaku: "Don't hold back, speak honestly."
Chihiro: "I-I'm grateful to you, Section Chief."
Yuusaku: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "For introducing me to such a lovely inn..."
Yuusaku: "...Nobody was expecting that kind of answer."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "If I don't hear even one sweet talk, there's no point in coming here."
Chihiro: "W-why is that?"
Yuusaku: "Because it takes the fun out of teasing you."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "Say you were happy just the two of you."
Chihiro: "I-I was happy."
Yuusaku: "With more feeling."
Chihiro: "I-I was happy sitting face-to-face with Sho-chan."
Yuusaku: "You must have been pretty lovey-dovey."
Chihiro: "W-We were... a little."
Yuusaku: "For example?"
Chihiro: "E-even if you say 'for example'..."
Yuusaku: "Did you kiss while eating?"
Chihiro: "We wouldn't do such a thing."
Yuusaku: "Then did you let him suck on your breasts?"
Chihiro: "I-It's not something you do during a meal."
Yuusaku: "Then how did you two flirt?"
Chihiro: "I-I fed him by saying 'ahh'."
Yuusaku: "'Ahh'?"
Chihiro: "I fed Sho-chan with my chopsticks..."
Yuusaku: "...Huh."
Chihiro: "I-I'm sorry."
Yuusaku: "Cliché, but nice."
Chihiro: "..."
Yuusaku: "But based on what I've heard so far..."
I let out a sigh.
I'm holding back my smirk.
I finally got to say the words I've been dying to say.
Yuusaku: "I am completely out of place here. I mean, when my subordinate is trying to enjoy some alone time, I go ahead and book the same inn."
Chihiro: "That's... that's not true."
Yuusaku: "Well, I'm just here for an overnight stay starting this evening, on a bland solo trip."
Chihiro: "If you're bored alone, you can join us from tomorrow..."
Yuusaku: "Learn a little, idiot."
Chihiro: "..."
It's been a while...
Since I last called her an idiot.
Chihiro, taken aback, blinked her big eyes in surprise.
Yuusaku: "Why won't you give the response I want?"
Chihiro: "I... I'm sorry."
Yuusaku: "Say it."
Chihiro: "You're... you're in the way, Section Chief."
Yuusaku: "Say it again, with feeling."
Chihiro: "I... I hate seeing your face so much, you're in the way."
Yuusaku: "...That's better."
I nodded in satisfaction...
Then I turned my gaze to the view outside.
Even though it was difficult to see at this hour...
I pretended to appreciate the scenery.
Yuusaku: "...The view from the second floor seems nice."
Chihiro: "Sho-chan was really pleased with it, too."
Yuusaku: "Well, that's good..."
But...
Chihiro: "Yes?"
Yuusaku: "The view he was happy about... it was you, wasn't it?"
Chihiro: "...Me?"
Yuusaku: "Yeah, you."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yuusaku: "Two big, round hills."
I turned my gaze back to Chihiro.
I'm eyeing her body with an unmistakable look.
Her yukata, which I was seeing for the first time, was more alluring than I had imagined.
It showcased her tempting curves that could excite me just by brushing against them.
Yuusaku: "Your breasts stand out more than usual."
Chihiro: "...I'm aware."
Yuusaku: "Did everyone stare at you?"
Chihiro: "No... nothing like that."
Yuusaku: "There should have been other guests, albeit few."
Chihiro: "I... I tried to avoid going out in the hallway as much as possible."
Yuusaku: "Indeed, it might be better not to wander around alone."
Chihiro: "Am... am I that unsightly?"
Yuusaku: "That's not what I mean."
Chihiro: "Then why...?"
Yuusaku: "You know the saying 'What happens on the road, stays on the road'? Even a usually calm old man can transform into a wolf with the power of alcohol..."
Chihiro: "Wait, wait..."
Yuusaku: "You could be assaulted three times before you get back to your room."
Chihiro: "Please, don't say such strange things."
Yuusaku: "Just passing by, I feel like I'm being seduced."
Chihiro: "I wouldn't give suggestive looks to strangers..."
Yuusaku: "It's not about the eyes, it's the breasts."
Chihiro: "...What?"
Yuusaku: "In your case, it's the breasts that are seducing."
Chihiro: "No, no way..."
Yuusaku: "Can't be helped with that size, right?"
Chihiro: "Do they look that provocative?"
Yuusaku: "Oh, absolutely."
Chihiro: "..."
Yuusaku: "Especially, the shape is suggestive."
Chihiro: "...There's nothing I can do about that."
Yuusaku: "Even over the yukata, the outline is clear."
Chihiro: "But I can't do anything about it..."
Yuusaku: "It feels like I'm looking at bare breasts."
Chihiro: "But... that's because..."
Yuusaku: "...Because?"
Chihiro: "...Because you... told me in a message..."
Yuusaku: "..."
Chihiro: "You told me not to wear underwear..."
Yuusaku: "Oh really..."
Chihiro: "..."
Yuusaku: "You're actually obeying my orders."
Chihiro: "...I am."
Yuusaku: "Really?"
Chihiro: "That's why my breast shape stands out even more..."
Yuusaku: "Show me the proof."
Chihiro: "What?"
Yuusaku: "Proof that you're not wearing a bra."
Chihiro: "..."
Chihiro hesitated for a moment.
Was she going to show me her breasts from above?
She was trying to spread the collar of her yukata.
Yuusaku: "It's a shame to ruin the nice outfit."
Chihiro: "But there's no other way..."
Yuusaku: "I think there's a much simpler way."
Chihiro: "A simpler way... a simpler way..."
I can't think of anything.
Yuusaku: "Just jump on the spot."
Chihiro: "???"
Yuusaku: "Keep your feet together and hop."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Chihiro: "Oh..."
With one hand, I skilfully untie the knot.
Without holding back, I pull at the end.
Chihiro: "Kyaa!!"
Chihiro's body spins round and round.
Her breasts sway with the centrifugal force...
And she falls flat on her bottom.
Without a moment's hesitation...
I put the yukata string around Chihiro's neck.
The loosened yukata spreads out sloppily, barely resting on her back.
Yuusaku: "Tonight is the day to advance your 'piece', my lady."
Chihiro: "Ah!!"
Yuusaku: "Struggling will only make you out of breath."
Chihiro: "N-No, we can't go out into the hallway."
Yuusaku: "Shut up, mutt."
Chihiro: "M-Mutt?"
Yuusaku: "I'm going to take you for a walk, so be happy about it."
Chihiro: "W-What are you talking about..."
Yuusaku: "Heh heh..."
I'm totally not listening to Chihiro's protests.
I'm not in the mood to listen to anything she has to say.
I forcefully pull her towards our destination.
Chihiro: "M-My yukata is coming undone..."
Yuusaku: "...So?"
Chihiro: "W-What if someone comes?"
Yuusaku: "...Who cares."
This is a hallway in a ryokan.
Like I said before, there are other guests here.
I understand that there is a risk.
But you see, my lady.
It's this thrill that gets you wet.
Your ears turning red with embarrassment.
Your hot skin makes your heart flutter.
No need for sweet caresses.
Something more stimulating than that.
An exquisite foreplay that no one else can imitate.
Slowly...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yuusaku: "What's wrong?"
Chihiro: "N-Nothing..."
Drip.
Chihiro: "Ah...!"
Yuusaku: "Hmm."
Chihiro: "Ah...no..."
Yuusaku: "If you need to pee, I'll take you to the toilet."
Chihiro: "Y-Your voice is too loud."
Yuusaku: "Or do you need to poop?"
Chihiro: "Please stop talking."
Yuusaku: "That depends on your reasons."
Chihiro: "O-Other guests might hear."
Yuusaku: "And that's a problem because?"
Chihiro: "T-They might come out into the hallway."
Yuusaku: "Who's coming out?"
Chihiro: "S-Strangers."
Yuusaku: "That's convenient."
Chihiro: "N-Not convenient at all."
Yuusaku: "Just relax."
Pull...
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yuusaku: "I'm the best at making up excuses on the spot. Even if you're performing fellatio, I'll divert attention."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
At those words, Chihiro despaired.
She decided to focus only on escaping from this situation.
She moves her hands and feet so quickly that her yukata comes undone.
Squirming and writhing.
On all fours, just like a real dog.
But she never tries to stand up.
Even in this situation, she doesn't resist completely.
How cute.
As always, my lady.
In accepting these conflicting parts of yourself,
You're becoming more and more of a desirable woman.
Chihiro: "Where are we going...?"
Yuusaku: "To where Shou is."
Chihiro: "...Eh?"
Yuusaku: "To the open-air bath where your beloved husband is waiting."
Chihiro: "N-No way..."
Yuusaku: "...It's true."
I don't turn around to respond, just speak.
But I can hear her gasp from behind me.
I can almost see her blood-drained face.
Chihiro: "T-This is a joke, right?"
Yuusaku: "Didn't you promise him?"
Chihiro: "P-Please stop."
Yuusaku: "It's pitiful for your husband to be alone all this time."
Chihiro: "H-He doesn't know that you're here."
Yuusaku: "Of course, I won't get close to him. That goes for you too, my lady."
Chihiro: "I-I don't understand what you mean."
Pull...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
The floor string biting into her neck.
Look.
We're almost at the entrance to the open-air bath.
After passing through the door, there's a changing room on the left.
From there, a corridor leads to the bath.
Knowing him, there's not a shred of doubt.
He's probably lounging in the bathtub right now,
Eagerly waiting for his beloved wife to come.
But it's unfortunate.
Chihiro can't make it there.
In the middle of the corridor, there's a small rocky area.
From there, she will gaze at your figure,
And shed tears of embarrassment amidst the steam...
