Yusaku: "..."
It's exactly 4 PM.
Aching, huh?
My dick is out of control.
Calm down a bit.
I'll put it in your favorite pussy soon.
...
Ding... whoosh...
Yusaku: "..."
I arrived on the third floor in no time.
Today, I used the elevator instead of the stairs.
The reason is simple.
It's hard to walk because of my erect dick.
I put my hand in my pocket to hide the bulge.
There's no one around.
All I have to do now is press the chime of room 303, my chest and crotch swelling with anticipation.
Ding dong.
Yusaku: "Heh..."
There's nothing to worry about.
She will definitely open the door.
Judging from last night, the situation is fermenting more than I thought.
Isn't that right, Madam?
You wanted me to be the usual me, didn't you?
You were expecting words that would make you shrink, weren't you?
Ding dong.
Yusaku: "..."
What is it?
The toilet?
But I have time.
I bend over.
I peek at the inside through the mailbox slot.
There's no sound.
But the lights are on.
So, the Madam is home.
Ding dong.
Yusaku: "..."
I rang the chime and several minutes passed.
Even I, with a broad mind, am getting irritated.
This bastard.
Enough is enough.
Is she really not going to open?
I bend over again.
This time, I bring my mouth close to the mailbox.
She can't ignore me, no matter how hard she tries.
Yusaku: "Don't pretend you're not home!"
I'm almost like a loan shark.
From there, it's a parade of abuse.
I squat in front of the mailbox.
I yell loudly about what I've done so far.
Reputation is the most important thing for the Madam.
Look.
It's effective.
Sounds like she's in a hurry.
I can hear the sound of her footsteps approaching the door...
Click...
Shota: "Huh..."
Yusaku: "(Ugh...)"
Shota: "Ch, Chief..."
Yusaku: "W, why are you here...?"
Shota: "Wh, what were you saying just now?"
Yusaku: "..."
Shota: "Is it true that you had sex with Chihiro?"
Yusaku: "W, well, that is..."
As I respond, my brain is spinning at high speed.
This is bad.
I've highlighted the worst part of the story.
This won't work.
The door to the excuse is firmly closed.
Yusaku: "...Well, calm down."
Shota: "S, so it's true!!"
Yusaku: "Is that how you talk to your boss?"
Shota: "Huh..."
In a half-hearted frenzy, I decide to use my position to silence him.
Yusaku: "Let's have a constructive discussion."
Shota: "Don't... Don't... Don't joke around!!"
Yusaku: "Ugh..."
This idiot suddenly grabs my collar. Despite his vigorous demeanor, his body seems weak. What's wrong with him? Is he sick?
I can win. Easily.
Step aside.
Shota: "Hig..."
Thud.
I knee him in the groin. It sinks in perfectly. He clutches his stomach and mouth. He crouches at my feet, sitting on his heels. Serves him right.
Shota: "U...gu...u..."
Yusaku: "Didn't I tell you to calm down?"
Shota: "Please... say it was a lie..."
Yusaku: "Okay, it's a lie."
Shota: "I...I can't believe that."
Yusaku: "Seems like you want to get kicked again."
Shota: "I... I respected you, manager..."
Yusaku: "If that's the case, you should be pleased that I bedded your beloved wife."
Shota: "U..."
Yusaku: "She's too good for just you."
Shota: "Chihiro... with your filthy... "
Yusaku: "She enjoyed it because I'm big."
Shota: "Waaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"
Suddenly, he screams and starts rolling around like a madman, banging his head against everything. What a pitiful sight. A man losing his composure.
Shota: "Uh..."
Yusaku: "Ugh..."
Shota: "Say it again."
Yusaku: "..."
I'm the fool for thinking he was just throwing a tantrum. He still has that insane look on his face. He's fetched a kitchen knife.
Shota: "Say what you said earlier one more time!!"
Yusaku: "And what will you do if I say it?"
Shota: "Chihiro would never enjoy it. She would never betray me!!"
Yusaku: "Hey, hey..."
Damn it. Don't swing that knife around. It's dangerous. I grab his arm as he charges at me, just in time. I sweep his legs out from under him while pressing my arm against his throat.
Thud.
We both fall, and then it's a jumble of limbs. We're on top one moment, at the bottom the next, with a knife between us. His strength now is incomparable to earlier. Calm down, damn it. Does he really intend to stab me?
Yusaku: "Drop... drop the knife."
Shota: "My Chihiro... My Chihiro... ah..."
Yusaku: "You... you..."
Slash!!
Shota: "Ha...ha...ha...ah..."
Yusaku: "Ah..."
Shota: "It...hurts... I can't breathe..."
Yusaku: "..."
It's not intentional. This is a proper self-defense. He was the one who came at me with a knife. So, I'm not in the wrong. But this is unbelievable. Blood is spurting out like a fountain. His body begins to twitch. Without even blinking, the color drains from his face. Upon closer inspection, the knife has pierced his heart, with more than half of it buried inside. This is hopeless. There's no way he can survive. At best, it's involuntary manslaughter. At worst, a full-fledged murder? This is no joke. I don't want to go to prison. I need to do something. I must also keep Chihiro, who knows about our involvement, quiet...
