You mustn't speak to me.
Even without that, my body is trembling.
I feel like I'm about to let out an indecent moan.
The distance between Shota and me is only a few meters.
It's like walking a tightrope without a safety line.
Honestly, I can't believe I'm doing this.
The section chief, who gives orders with a glance, is awful.
But I'm also at fault for obediently complying even in fear.
Chihiro: "Mm...guh..."
An overwhelming sense of guilt.
But my feelings don't stop at that.
As much as I feel sorry for my husband, I wet the inside of my thin cloth indecently.
I know my reasoning is messed up.
But there's nothing I can do about it.
If I could do something, I would've done it long ago.
Right now, I can only obediently comply.
I might not even need a reason to resist the section chief anymore.
Chihiro: "Mmm... smooch..."
Shota: "...Chihiro?"
Chihiro: "...Uu."
Shota: "Sh-should I help you wipe too?"
