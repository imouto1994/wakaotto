...One month later...
**: "Section Chief."
Yusaku: "..."
**: "...Section Chief?"
Yusaku: "Huh?"
**: "Regarding the chestnut gathering event, in terms of the budget, it should be according to the amount on this document..."
Yusaku: "...You know."
**: "Y-yes?"
Yusaku: "You should talk to Akizuki about that, not me..."
**: "Huh?"
Yusaku: "..."
That's right.
He already quit.
Yusaku: "Just handle it properly yourself. If you ask me about everything, you'll never move up. "
**: "Y-yes, sir..."
Yusaku: "If you understand, go back to your desk. I want to think."
**: "Ah, I'm sorry."
Yusaku: "..."
Yusaku: "...This idiot."
I glare at the back of the fool leaving.
I angrily kick the back of my desk with my toes.
Everything is so boring.
Yusaku: "Hmph..."
One month since then.
I'm back to my previous boring days.
Just work, go back to my room, watch adult videos and indulge in self-pleasure.
What else should I do?
Find a new woman?
Damn it.
If that's what you want, convince me.
Explain that disgusting incident to me so I understand.
Was it a spontaneous accident?
Was it a sudden act because of unbearable anxiety?
Or did you intend to do it from the beginning?
It's all foggy now.
But there's one thing I'm sure of.
I haven't given up yet.
That's why I still carry that underwear with me, never letting it out of my sight.
The pure white panties I took off just before going shopping.
For some reason, I couldn't bring myself to throw them away.
What happened to me?
Am I just lingering over the fact that I couldn't have sex?
Yusaku: "..."
No.
It's not just that.
A grain of sand slipped from my palm.
Something I'll never see again was in there.
I know that.
Damn it.
Someone, turn back time.
It's okay for a miracle to happen just once.
I won't fail again.
I promise that much.
So please.
I'll even make a deal with the devil if I have to.
Just grant my wish...
