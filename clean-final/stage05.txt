...The next day, 7 PM...
Ding-dong.
Chihiro: "Yes?"
Chihiro: "Welcome home."
Shota: "I'm home."
Chihiro: "..."
He seems very lively.
This morning he looked like he was struggling to even leave the house.
Chihiro: "I'll hold your bag."
Shota: "Thanks."
Chihiro: "..."
Shota goes straight to the living room.
I check the inside of the bag while aligning his shoes.
His lunch box is empty.
I could tell as soon as I picked it up.
He's in a great mood.
He's even home earlier than usual.
Everything is just as I expected.
It's glaringly obvious.
Chihiro: "Did something good happen?"
I wanted to make sure.
There wasn't much time left before I had to leave.
So, I asked him directly.
Shota: "Something good?"
Chihiro: "You seem more energetic compared to this morning."
Shota: "Well, yeah..."
He seems embarrassed about his change.
Shota: "I ended up being able to redo those documents myself."
Chihiro: "...I see."
Shota: "It seems like the deputy chief was kind enough to extend the deadline for me."
Chihiro: "The section manager did?"
Shota: "Yeah, he was unusually nice to me from this morning. I was able to attend the deputy chief meeting before lunch, and he introduced me as the hope of the team, and thanks to that..."
He points at his bag as he says this.
Shota: "My lunch box is empty."
Chihiro: "..."
I nod with a forced smile.
I should prepare myself.
This isn't just my selfish assumption.
Section Manager Hazama is purposely playing with Shota.
Using me as the reason.
Shota: "...Is it a good time for you?"
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Shota: "You're meeting up with your friend after a long time, right?"
Chihiro: "Y-yes."
I really need to hurry.
It takes 30 minutes to get from here to Section Manager Hazama's house.
Shota: "I'll make sure to stay home properly, so Chihiro, go and enjoy yourself."
Chihiro: "...Thank you."
Shota: "You should get dressed soon."
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Shota: "You're not going in your jeans, are you?"
Chihiro: "...Is it not good to wear jeans?"
Shota: "You should dress up more. You're cute enough as it is, but still."
Chihiro: "I-I don't have time anymore."
Shota looks a bit puzzled.
He was staring at me, including my usual makeup.
I was busy checking my things.
I couldn't look up, fearing he would see through my lie.
My cell phone.
My personal alarm.
I have everything.
Chihiro: "So..."
Shota: "Yeah."
It's the first time he's seen me off at such a time.
My heart aches.
But I'll do my best.
To prevent Shota from being tormented for reasons other than work.
Chihiro: "I'm off."
Shota: "Call me if you need me to pick you up."
Chihiro: "..."
I nod ambiguously.
I waved goodbye with my hand, trying to hide my downcast face.
That's all I could manage.
I hear the sound of the door locking behind me.
From that moment, I felt incredibly vulnerable.
Chihiro: "..."
No.
I must stay strong.
Because this is something only I can do.
...
Probably due to the tension.
I didn't notice the people passing by at all.
I looked up at the full moon.
I was trying to sort out my feelings again.
I want Shota to continue his current job.
He must be hoping for the same.
I can't let things continue as they are.
I have to talk properly.
If I can resolve this, I should act quickly.
Otherwise, Shota will break down.
So that's why I responded to the invitation.
Of course, I didn't plan to have a meal or anything.
I intended to say what I needed to and then return home.
That would be the best case scenario.
If that doesn't work, I'll disclose everything to Shota.
I'll probably end up consulting with the deputy chief whom I've never met.
I was prepared to go that far.
Anyway, it's not good to do nothing and just stay quiet.
If I let it go, it will only escalate...
...
...
...
Yusaku: "Pfff..."
Feeling a little tipsy.
The clock has passed half past eight.
Still, I'm leisurely heading home.
I've got time.
It's a residential area so there aren't many people around.
The round moon.
Try being square for a change.
About a 10-minute walk from the station.
I finally see my house.
A five-story apartment building.
A one-room apartment with a rent of 150,000 yen.
It's a rip-off.
Yusaku: "Guh..."
I observe the entrance area from a distance.
There's someone there.
A figure under the arch.
The silhouette suggests it's a woman.
She's got a good figure.
I'll give her that.
Yusaku: "...Good evening."
Chihiro: "P-please, keep your promise."
Oh my.
It seems she's not happy about my being late.
A cheeky attitude despite having waved the white flag.
She might just be a strong-willed woman.
Chihiro: "...Have you been drinking?"
Yusaku: "When I drink, I get a better erection."
Chihiro: "..."
The lady's face stiffens at the crude words.
Yusaku: "Well then, allow me to invite you into my home."
Chihiro: "No, thank you."
Yusaku: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "We can talk right here."
Yusaku: "..."
This isn't going according to plan.
What does she mean by "talk"?
So she's not a naive woman who easily understands things?
I switched gears instantly.
I forcibly drove the alcohol out of my mind.
Yusaku: "Well, regards to Akizuki-kun."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I left the woman behind.
Alone, I started walking towards my room.
Chihiro, the lady of the house, was in a panic.
Of course she would be.
She was so determined.
So I decided to use that to my advantage.
Chihiro: "W-wait a minute!"
Nope.
Chihiro: "..."
The woman grabs the back of my suit.
Hey, hey.
You're going to wrinkle it.
But I deliberately didn't shake her off.
I only hastened my pace even more.
I purposely didn't use the elevator.
I chose the deserted emergency staircase outside.
My goal was to bring the woman into my room.
It's best to avoid confined spaces until then.
...
The door creaks open...
Yusaku: "Welcome."
Chihiro: "...Haah...Haah..."
Yusaku: "Want something to drink?"
Chihiro: "...I don't need it."
Yusaku: "Well then, find a spot and sit down."
Chihiro: "I'm fine standing."
Yusaku: "..."
I see.
So she doesn't even plan to share a meal with me.
The hormone skewers I got wrapped at the yakitori shop are sad.
She plans to finish the conversation quickly and head home.
Her coming in jeans makes weird sense.
I need to apologize for misunderstanding.
You're not a woman who spreads her legs that easily, it seems.
Yusaku: "Don't be so tense."
Chihiro: "W-why couldn't we talk outside?"
Yusaku: "I have a public image to uphold too. At this hour, with someone like you..."
If I were seen chatting with a beautiful wife...
If I were seen chatting with an ugly wife...
Yusaku: "If I were seen chatting with a beautiful wife, rumors might start, right?"
Chihiro: "..."
The woman clearly looks disgusted.
Yusaku: "I'm still single after all."
Chihiro: "T-then you should have called me to another place."
Yusaku: "I like my own room."
Chihiro: "That's entirely up to you, Section Chief."
Yusaku: "What's wrong with that?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "You're the one who answered my call, after all."
Chihiro: "...I can't just leave it like this."
Yusaku: "If I'm seen chatting with an ugly wife, rumors might start, right?"
Chihiro: "Ug...ugly..."
The woman's face contorts at the unfamiliar words.
Serves her right.
Yusaku: "I'm still single after all."
Chihiro: "If...if you think that way, please don't invite me for meals."
Yusaku: "I've always had a taste for the grotesque."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Why did you agree to come?"
Chihiro: "...I didn't come to have a meal."
Yusaku: "I thought as much."
Chihiro: "...I just couldn't leave it like this."
Yusaku: "What do you mean?"
Chihiro: "D-don't play dumb."
Yusaku: "..."
Huh.
I'm surprised she came to protest so earnestly.
Nice.
I like her even more now.
I don't dislike women with a backbone.
It's worth sharing her with her husband.
Chihiro: "I want you to stop doing strange things."
Yusaku: "I don't understand what you're saying."
Chihiro: "P-please don't toy with my husband anymore."
Yusaku: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "I'm not going to complain about him being busy. But you, Section Chief, you unnecessarily flatter him, and then suddenly drop him into the abyss..."
Yusaku: "Don't interfere with business matters."
Chihiro: "Y-you are being mean because of me, aren't you?"
Yusaku: "Your victim complex is severe."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Are you seriously saying this, ma'am?"
Chihiro: "I-I've even lied to my husband to come here and talk to you. I wish you wouldn't deceive me, Section Chief."
Yusaku: "You're really self-conscious, aren't you?"
Chihiro: "...I'm self-conscious?"
Yusaku: "You're the type who can't be satisfied unless you draw attention to yourself, right?"
Chihiro: "...You stole my underwear in the changing room."
Yusaku: "You should watch your words. I said that was an accident."
Chihiro: "A-and you groped me on the train."
Yusaku: "..."
Chihiro: "Am I still being self-conscious?"
Yusaku: "Hmph..."
Chihiro: "Am I irrelevant to my husband?"
Yusaku: "Who was it that enjoyed being touched?"
Chihiro: "Eh?"
Yusaku: "Your thighs were oddly slippery, weren't they?"
Slap!!
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Ouch."
Chihiro: "W-why on earth did you do such a thing...?"
Yusaku: "Apologize before you ask."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Apologize for slapping me."
Chihiro: "B-but, Section Chief, you said something terrible..."
Yusaku: "Ah, it hurts."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "I thought you broke my back tooth."
Chihiro: "...I'm sorry for slapping you... I... I apologize..."
Yusaku: "Your honesty is also nice."
Chihiro: "...Eh?"
Yusaku: "I don't dislike lively people like you, ma'am."
Chihiro: "...Please stay away from me."
Yusaku: "I thought I'd tell you my purpose."
Chihiro: "Y-you could just say it, couldn't you?"
Yusaku: "..."
The woman puts her hand in her jeans pocket.
She's got something.
It's not a cellphone, judging by the size.
This feels dangerous.
I stop my advancing foot.
Yusaku: "Well, I'll answer you as you wish."
Chihiro: "...Please do."
Yusaku: "I want to marry you too."
Chihiro: "M-marriage?"
The most surprised face I've ever seen.
Is she so happy she can't even close her mouth?
Chihiro: "So it's such a terrible reason that you can't answer seriously."
Yusaku: "I intended to answer seriously."
Chihiro: "D-don't joke around."
Yusaku: "Does it look like I'm joking?"
Chihiro: "I-I'm already married."
Yusaku: "That's why I want to share you."
Chihiro: "Sh-share?"
Yusaku: "Isn't it a waste to have only Akizuki-kun?"
Chihiro: "I don't understand what you're saying."
Yusaku: "Treat me as important as him."
Chihiro: "...You're joking after all."
Yusaku: "From now on, you'll make my lunch too."
Chihiro: "W-why should I do such a thing...?"
Yusaku: "And you'll stay over here every other day."
Chihiro: "E-enough already."
Yusaku: "If you do that, I won't do anything bad."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Leave Akizuki-kun's matter to me."
Chihiro: "I refuse."
Yusaku: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "There's no way my husband would want that. He should be satisfied if he just receives a fair evaluation from you, Section Chief."
Yusaku: "...And what if that evaluation is bad?"
Chihiro: "If that's what you think, then there's nothing I can do."
Yusaku: "That means both of you would end up destitute."
Chihiro: "Even so, I will follow him."
Yusaku: "...You're completely smitten."
Chihiro: "That's why I married him."
Yusaku: "So you're saying my proposal isn't a joke."
Chihiro: "I have no intention of being close to a man other than my husband."
Yusaku: "So, you're only for your husband?"
Chihiro: "Isn't it obvious for a married woman?"
Yusaku: "..."
This is tough.
I'm seriously getting excited.
Chihiro: "Your way of thinking, Section Chief, is strange."
Yusaku: "...Maybe."
Click.
Chihiro: "W-what are you...?"
Yusaku: "Just took a picture with my phone."
Chihiro: "...Please stop doing that."
Yusaku: "It's the first and last time, so let me commemorate it with a photo."
Chihiro: "...First and last?"
Yusaku: "This is the end."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "I'm envious of Akizuki-kun for having a wife like you."
Chihiro: "...Even if you praise me, I'm not happy."
Yusaku: "If I had a wife like you, I wouldn't worry about being a honeymoon fool."
Chihiro: "If you have something to say, say it clearly..."
Yusaku: "At tomorrow's meeting, I'm going to appoint Akizuki-kun as a chief clerk."
Chihiro: "...Eh?"
Yusaku: "Of course, it's a promotion as a fair evaluation."
Chihiro: "E-even if you say such a thing all of a sudden..."
Yusaku: "I still have high expectations for Akizuki-kun."
Chihiro: "W-wait a moment, please."
Yusaku: "It's better to convey the notice of appointment directly from me, right?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "For now, congratulations."
I deliberately extend my hand.
The wife, not understanding why, withdraws her hand.
I stepped forward and forcibly shook her hand.
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
Chihiro: "N-no..."
She stands there, taken aback.
She seems to have even forgotten to blink.
Yusaku: "If you're late, Akizuki-kun will worry."
Chihiro: "I won't be deceived anymore."
Yusaku: "...You're a suspicious person."
Chihiro: "P-please give me a proper answer."
Yusaku: "About what?"
Chihiro: "I don't want to cause trouble for my husband because of me."
Yusaku: "I promise."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I head to the front door alone.
I urge the wife to go home quickly.
Yusaku: "There's no more pointless games. I've given up on sharing you."
Chihiro: "...R-really?"
Yusaku: "I don't lie. Well, good night."
Chihiro: "..."
...Clatter...Bang...
Yusaku: "..."
The place where the woman was standing.
I stare at it intently.
I could have violated her if I didn't think about the consequences.
But she's too good for that.
Not just her appearance, but her inner self is also solid.
I'm finally starting to understand how to enjoy her.
And yet, you're giving up on sharing her?
Of course, I'm not lying.
I intend to monopolize her, not share her.
Eventually, the wife will be mine alone.
It's okay for them to be just a couple in name.
But before that, I'll educate her properly.
I have to make her understand that her thinking is wrong, deep in her body.
That's right.
There's no way this is the end.
This is where the real hell begins...
...
...
...
Ding-dong.
Shota: "Yes?"
Chihiro: "..."
Shota-chan's voice.
It warms my heart.
The tension seems about to snap.
Chihiro: "...I'm home."
Shota: "Welcome back."
Chihiro: "..."
I really want to hug him.
I want him to hold me tight.
But I have to hold back.
Shota: "You're back earlier than I thought."
Chihiro: "Is, is that so?"
While replying, my gaze goes to my wristwatch.
The gesture was a bit deliberate.
A lie I couldn't help but tell.
It's still making my behavior awkward.
Shota: "Didn't you drink?"
Chihiro: "...Just a meal."
Shota: "I see."
I hope my stomach doesn't growl.
I was desperately putting pressure on my navel.
Lying is not the thing to do after all.
Even if it's a small thing.
I deeply believe that.
Chihiro: "Did you eat properly?"
Shota: "Yeah, I warmed it up as it was written in the memo."
Chihiro: "And the bath?"
Shota: "I just took a shower."
Chihiro: "Then, I will too..."
Still holding my bag, I head to the bathroom.
I didn't want to leave anything in the living room.
The smell that filled the Section Chief's room.
It feels like it's stuck to all my belongings.
Chihiro: "..."
As soon as I close the door, I fumble in my pocket.
The crime prevention buzzer that I didn't have to use.
First, it goes deep into my bag.
All my clothes are in the washing machine.
Now it should be fine.
I should be able to erase all the traces.
Whoosh...
The faucet is half hot and half cold water.
I let the sweat flow from my head to my toes with a slightly strong stream.
Chihiro: "Haah..."
I wonder if Shota-chan will come too.
I'm feeling very lonely.
I'm alone with body soap in my hand.
I lather my body without stopping the shower.
I also take care of my armpits while I'm at it.
If I don't do it every day in the summer, I feel embarrassed.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I remembered something unpleasant.
Just when I was able to let one burden off my shoulders.
Yes.
Actually, my period hasn't come even after the due date.
Today is the fourth day.
I'm pretty worried.
Recently, it's been coming on a certain day every month.
I gently stroked around my navel.
The line of my belly is the same as always.
Of course.
I wonder if I should buy a pregnancy test tomorrow.
It's embarrassing to go straight to the gynecologist.
Shota: "Hey."
Chihiro: "Wh-what?"
Shota-chan's voice through the door.
I quickly take my hand away from my belly.
Shota: "Do you want to drink beer when you come out?"
Chihiro: "Ye-yeah... I'll drink..."
Shota: "Then, I'll prepare some simple snacks."
Chihiro: "..."
He's gone.
I wish he had opened the door a little.
But I'm calmer than I was earlier.
I wonder why.
I touch my belly again.
It's strange.
When I do this, I feel strangely relaxed.
The face reflected in the mirror is also slightly smiling.
No, stop it.
I'm such a fool.
I make a face at the mirror on purpose.
I swear at my indecisive self.
There's no point in thinking about this and that here and now.
There's only one way to make it clear.
Tomorrow, when Shota-chan goes out, I'll go to the pharmacy...
...
...
...
