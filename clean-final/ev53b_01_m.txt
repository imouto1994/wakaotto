Squish... squish... squish...
Chihiro: "Hah... Don't... don't call anyone..."
Yuusaku: "There's no need to be so scared."
Chihiro: "But... but..."
Yuusaku: "Even the aftercare is fully prepared."
Squish... squish... slurp... slurp...
Chihiro: "Ah... no... it's too fast... slower..."
Yuusaku: "What happened to Mr. Sakamoto on the first floor?"
Chihiro: "He... he moved out."
Yuusaku: "What about your neighbor, Mr. Saito?"
Chihiro: "He... divorced, and now only his wife is there..."
Yuusaku: "What about the fat man who noticed you in the city?"
Slurp... slurp... squish... squish...
Chihiro: "Ah... since then... hah... hah... I haven't seen him..."
Yuusaku: "What about the liquor store and the cleaning shop?"
Chihiro: "Both of them are really scared... when I go to the store, they hide in the back... so the wives always take their place..."
Yuusaku: "What about the manager?"
Chihiro: "He's very kind to me. He helps me decline newspaper subscriptions, and when I need to dispose of heavy trash..."
Yuusaku: "So, there's no problem."
Chihiro: "Not me... but everyone else..."
Yuusaku: "They could fulfill their desires."
Thrust...
Chihiro: "Ah... ah..."
Yuusaku: "That's why it's okay."
Chihiro: "But..."
Yuusaku: "But?"
Chihiro: "I... I don't want semen anymore... I want to feel good with... with your penis... with your penis, Manager..."
Yuusaku: "You can relax."
Thrust...
Chihiro: "Ah... ah... ah..."
Yuusaku: "Your wish will be granted."
Chihiro: "So... you won't call anyone?"
Yuusaku: "Call them? They're already here."
Silence.
