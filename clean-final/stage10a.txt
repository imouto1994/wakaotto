Yusaku: "Were you bored?"
Chihiro: "...Where is my husband?"
He's right behind you
I'm already tired of seeing your wife's pussy
Yusaku: "He's right behind you."
Chihiro: "Wha-!?"
Yusaku: "Just kidding, just kidding."
Chihiro: "Hmph..."
Yusaku: "It's better to go home than to look at your dirty pussy."
Yusaku: "I'm already tired of seeing your pussy."
Chihiro: "I don't care about that."
Yusaku: "Even though you're really hurt."
Chihiro: "Not at all."
Yusaku: "There's a trace of tears in the corner of your eye."
Chihiro: "Give me back my jeans quickly."
Yusaku: "You came here in that outfit, didn't you?"
Chihiro: "I don't want to hear such a humorless joke."
Yusaku: "I hate women who are not relaxed."
A brown paper bag prepared in advance...
I throw it arrogantly.
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Pick it up."
Chihiro: "What is this?"
Yusaku: "Jeans."
Chihiro: "It can't fit in such a small bag."
Yusaku: "I want you to try it on."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "I'll give you back your jeans and underwear later."
Chihiro: "You can throw away the underwear."
Yusaku: "Did you get a thrill out of going commando?"
Chihiro: "I don't want to wear anything you've touched ever again."
Yusaku: "You don't say..."
This is nice...
I'm excited.
Chihiro, the wife who is desperately trying to hide her pubic hair and putting on a brave front.
This is something I couldn't imagine from you before.
Yusaku: "So, what will you do?"
Chihiro: "Please tell me what's in it."
Yusaku: "That's the fun of seeing it."
Chihiro: "Will you delete that photo if I try it on?"
Yusaku: "The price for that is returning your jeans. Nothing more, nothing less."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "If you don't like it, you can go home as you are."
Chihiro: "You're a coward."
Yusaku: "I'll let that remark slide this time. If you don't want to change in front of me, you can use the washroom in the back."
Yusaku: "..."
Yusaku: "...Heh."
In the end, you do as I say.
The most you can do now is to pretend to be in a bad mood.
That's the best you can do to put on a brave front.
The tightly closed bathroom door.
I stand in front of it, listening intently.
I can hear it.
The bitter breath of the wife.
Yusaku: "Hurry up already."
Chihiro: "Can't you stop this nonsense?"
Yusaku: "What's wrong?"
Chihiro: "I can't wear this!"
Yusaku: "Then go home with your lower half naked."
Chihiro: "Give me back my jeans first."
Yusaku: "The condition is that you try this on."
Chihiro: "I'm... I'm already wearing it."
Yusaku: "Oh really..."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Then come out."
Chihiro: "No, I can't."
Yusaku: "You have to show me, or you're not meeting the conditions."
Chihiro: "Absolutely not."
Yusaku: "Tch..."
I tried to turn the knob without thinking.
But the moment it opened just a few centimeters...
Chihiro tried to close it with twice the force.
Yusaku: "Are you planning to live there?"
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "If you want, I can call your husband back."
*Rub*...
Chihiro: "Ah!"
*Bounce*... *wobble*...
Chihiro: "..."
As I pulled her out along with the door...
Her breasts bounced.
If they jiggled a bit more...
Her nipples would peek out.
Chihiro: "Don't look."
Yusaku: "You changed so I could see, right?"
Chihiro: "What's your goal with this...?"
Yusaku: "Haven't I been saying that it's for you to try on? You'll be showing off that provocative swimsuit at the reception the day after tomorrow."
Chihiro: "What!?"
Yusaku: "It's an important event that will determine your husband's future. It might be a bit too much for the kids, but it's perfect for the lecherous officials."
Chihiro: "I don't understand what you're saying."
Yusaku: "It's a great opportunity to help your husband."
Chihiro: "No matter the reason, I will never wear this swimsuit again..."
Yusaku: "..."
I dropped my waist...
I then glared at Chihiro's face from below.
Yusaku: "You're going to wear it again."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "Helping your husband's career is what you want, right?"
Chihiro: "Don't make fun of me!"
Yusaku: "Oh really?"
Amazing.
Chihiro is shaking with anger.
But it lacks impact.
Not when her pubic hair is peeking out from the side of her bikini.
Yusaku: "So you're saying you won't accept my offer?"
Chihiro: "Isn't it obvious?"
Yusaku: "Why not?"
Chihiro: "I can't be seen in public like this!"
I think you're even more attractive than usual
I think you've become more pig-like and attention-grabbing.
Yusaku: "I think you're even more attractive than usual."
Chihiro: "I don't want to embarrass Shou-chan. I'm not some spectacle."
Yusaku: "I think you've become more pig-like and attention-grabbing."
Chihiro: "I'm aware I haven't lost weight."
Yusaku: "Even so, if you can attract attention, isn't that a woman's greatest joy?"
Chihiro: "...I don't want to be seen by anyone other than my husband."
Yusaku: "Ah, I see."
Chihiro: "...I've followed your order, now please return my jeans."
Yusaku: "If you don't wear it for the real thing, there's no point in trying it on."
Chihiro: "Isn't that just your own selfish reason?"
Yusaku: "Well, I can't help it..."
I rummaged through the back pocket of my pants.
I pulled out the last remaining print.
Yusaku: "How about making your hospitality debut with this one?"
Chihiro: "...Are you going to threaten me with that photo again?"
Yusaku: "It's not a threat, it's a proposal."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "The person we need to persuade is a famous erotic official from the Ministry of Debt. After getting to know you, this photo's value will increase significantly."
Chihiro: "Don't involve me in your work."
Yusaku: "Which do you prefer?"
Chihiro: "I don't want either."
Yusaku: "That's an impossible answer."
Chihiro: "What's impossible is this swimsuit."
Yusaku: "If you wear that, the erotic official will be drooling. Inflate his baseless expectations, and even the impossible becomes possible."
Chihiro: "Shou-chan would never allow such a thing."
Yusaku: "I thought you said you'd tell your husband when you got home."
Chihiro: "In that case, I'll show this swimsuit to my husband and ask if he agrees."
Yusaku: "... It's not for your husband to decide, it's for you."
Chihiro: "Just hurry up and return my jeans... I want to go home already."
Yusaku: "We're not getting anywhere like this..."
I stayed crouched down.
I'm looking as if I were deep in thought.
Yusaku: "What's the reason for your stubbornness?"
Chihiro: "...What do you mean?"
Yusaku: "Who was the woman who came four times in a row?"
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "Who was the woman who wet herself and moaned?"
Chihiro: "...You want to say that I'm not even worth refusing, don't you?"
Yusaku: "Is that wrong?"
Chihiro: "At least, Shou-chan doesn't think so."
Yusaku: "You're always so self-absorbed. He said he didn't want to put it in while observing your pussy."
Chihiro: "That was something he said without knowing it was me."
Yusaku: "So you think you're still loved the same?"
Chihiro: "He held me gently just yesterday."
Yusaku: "Oh really..."
Chihiro: "He also kissed me on the cheek."
Yusaku: "If you say that much..."
I offer my phone to Chihiro.
Yusaku: "Show me the pride of a loved woman."
Chihiro: "What...?"
Yusaku: "How about a bet with me right now?"
Chihiro: "...No."
Yusaku: "If I win, you wear that swimsuit. If I lose, you can do whatever you want with this."
Chihiro: "What kind of person are you..."
Yusaku: "I'm entrusting you with my phone, take it."
Chihiro: "...You're definitely up to something again."
Yusaku: "Of course I am."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "Let's see who can hold out the longest without climaxing."
Chihiro: "Don't say such stupid things."
Yusaku: "Then admit that you're not worth refusing."
Chihiro: "I don't want to make my relationship with Shou-chan a betting matter."
Yusaku: "Then this photo is a gift for the erotic official. You can come to the pool in a diving suit, fully protected."
Chihiro: "You're threatening me after all, aren't you?"
Yusaku: "How you take it is up to you. The right to choose is yours."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "If you can show me a woman's pride, not only can you do whatever you want with the phone... I'll get down on my knees and apologize for everything up to now."
Chihiro: "...You're the one who's misunderstanding."
Yusaku: "What do you mean?"
Chihiro: "What value does your kneeling have?"
Yusaku: "..."
Yusaku: "...You're tough."
I smirk.
Each of Chihiro's words makes my heart flutter.
Yusaku: "Then what do you think has value?"
Chihiro: "...Please quit your job at the city office instead of kneeling."
Yusaku: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "I... I don't want to be by Shou-chan's side anymore."
Yusaku: "I'm surprised you're even meddling in personal affairs."
Chihiro: "You're the one who's interfering with a married couple, aren't you?"
Yusaku: "Isn't it you who's interfering?"
Chihiro: "Me?"
Yusaku: "Lately, we've been quite lovey-dovey. I'm fond of him, and he needs me."
Chihiro: "That's because he doesn't know who you really are..."
Yusaku: "The one who's in the way isn't me, it's you, madam. Even with the hospitality matter, the one who's likely to be a drag is definitely you."
Chihiro: "You're just using my husband. There's no way Shou-chan can be happy with that!"
Yusaku: "If you think so, then bet on your pride. Save your poor husband from my evil clutches."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "I won't run away. I'll even accept the conditions of resignation."
Chihiro: "Ugh... ugh..."
Yusaku: "What will you do?"
Chihiro: "Ugh... ugh... ugh..."
Yusaku: "The jeans are under the bed. Change into them and go home whenever you want."
Chihiro: "...I'm not going home."
Yusaku: "Oh really..."
Chihiro: "Either choice will lead to hell anyway."
Yusaku: "If you make me cum first, it will be heaven, right?"
Chihiro: "As long as you keep that smug look on your face. I don't care about the attitude of a crude, vulgar person like a pervert."
Yusaku: "Heh..."
Chihiro: "You laugh just as your character is. Doesn't that kind of atmosphere affect your work?"
Shut up, idiot
Be more careful from now on
Yusaku: "Shut up, idiot."
Yusaku: "Be more careful from now on."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
She seems quite upset.
It must have really bothered her.
The words, "The one who's in the way for your husband is you."
Chihiro: "This time, I'll make you feel embarrassed."
Yusaku: "That's impressive."
Chihiro: "I'll make you understand how frustrated I am."
Yusaku: "...If you can, try it. You're a fellatio novice, madam."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
...
Splish...
Chihiro: "Mmm..."
Splish... squelch...
Yusaku: "What's wrong?"
Chihiro: "I... I didn't... cum."
Yusaku: "You're lying."
Slurp... lick... lick...
Slurp.
Chihiro: "Ah, Aaaaaaah!!"
Twitch, twitch, twitch, twitch, twitch...
Chihiro: "Ah, ah... I... I'm... I'm..."
Yusaku: "...Bingo."
Chihiro: "No... I didn't... I didn't..."
Twitch, twitch, twitch, twitch...
Chihiro: "Hyaa... ahh... ahh... ahhh... I... I'm... I'm..."
Clenching, squeezing...
Chihiro: "Aaaaaaaaaaaah!!"
Twitch, twitch... twitch... twitch...
Chihiro: "Hiii... no... more... aguu... haa... haa..."
Chihiro: "Nn... gu... haa... haa... ahh... haa... nn... haa... aah... aah... aah... it's... still... happening..."
Yusaku: "...Game over."
Gulp.
Chihiro: "Aguu... haa... haa... haa... aah..."
Yusaku: "You came, right?"
Chihiro: "I didn't..."
Chihiro: "!"
Splurt, splat...
Chihiro: "Ugh... ugh..."
Pulse, pulse, pulse... drip... splat... splat... splat...
Chihiro: "Ugh... no... it stinks..."
Pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse... spl... urt...
Yusaku: "Ah, that was amazing."
Chihiro: "Let me clean... quickly, my face..."
Yusaku: "Heh heh..."
Chihiro, unable to open her eyes because of the splattered semen.
I minimally move my body, reaching my arm to the hand pressing against her breasts.
Chihiro: "Ah!!"
Yusaku: "You're no longer entitled to do this."
Chihiro: "Stop!!"
Chihiro's face turns pale.
Not minding the semen getting into her eyes, she resists desperately.
Chihiro: "Wha... what are you..."
Yusaku: "Just stay still."
Chihiro: "Ah... no... wait... no... ah... aah..."
Rubbing... and then popping it off.
Chihiro: "G-give it back!!"
Yusaku: "N-o-p-e."
I pull off the silver ring from her ring finger.
I toss it into my mouth.
Chihiro: "That's... dirty."
From there, it's just a childish game of tag.
Me, running away teasingly.
The desperate wife chasing after me.
Without considering the disturbance to the neighbors, we run around making a ruckus.
Yusaku: "Catch me if you can."
Chihiro: "Don't... swallow it."
There was no longer any concern for her bouncing breasts.
Her face was a mess, smeared with semen and tears.
It's as if she had lost something as important as life itself.
No matter how much she chased after it, it was futile.
Eventually, Chihiro clung to her chest and crouched down.
Her sobs were audible.
Of course, I left her alone.
I put the ring that I had taken out of my mouth on my little finger
I then cast a cold glance at Chihiro.
Proudly, I paraded around in circles.
It felt good.
The masochistic scent emanating from the crouching wife was intoxicating.
Even after you leave, the lingering scent will likely satisfy me.
...
Chihiro: "Hic..."
Yusaku: "Go home already."
Chihiro: "Sniff... your... ring..."
Yusaku: "You're persistent, wife."
Chihiro: "I can't go home without it."
Yusaku: "It's not like you breathe through that ring. Don't forget our promise for the day after tomorrow."
Chihiro: "Hic..."
Yusaku: "Remember, you lost our bet. If you want to challenge me again, I'll always be ready... Heh heh."
Chihiro: "You... inhuman... idiot... die..."
...
...
