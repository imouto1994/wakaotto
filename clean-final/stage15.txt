...Two days later...
Chihiro: "Huff..."
It's okay.
The door is locked.
All that's left is to turn off the lights and leave the room.
The time is just past 6 PM.
If I leave now, I'll arrive just at the promised time.
As instructed, I'm wearing a white, sleeveless top.
And I properly put on a skirt as well.
I've prepared toiletries, just in case.
Of course, I haven't forgotten my cell phone.
Whenever Shou calls, I'll answer.
No matter what is being done to me at that time.
Click... Slam...
Chihiro: "Ah... "
I'm sorry.
It's not really a friend's house.
The destination is the room of the section chief you admire.
Yes.
To lessen the shadow of my uncle.
To be freed from the trauma that's been ingrained in me.
I hate to do such a thing while he's on a business trip, but...
They said the treatment would take time...
Ding... Hiss...
Chihiro: "... "
I was really torn about what to do.
I thought about just staying still in the room and doing nothing.
But then I would remain timid forever.
If I go out, I shrink under the gaze of men.
Feeling suffocated by my tight bra.
Just tiptoeing along the edges of the road as usual.
On top of that, all that comes to mind are strange fantasies.
Despite my reluctance, my underwear gets wet for some reason.
It's the same with sex.
I finally understood when the section chief told me.
I've been scornful somewhere in my heart.
Not only the act itself.
But also the body being held.
The guilt of being molested by my uncle.
I've been dragging it along since then.
I want to erase that consciousness.
I want to reclaim my true self and be reborn.
There are as many reasons as there are stars.
But it's not about the petty details anymore.
I just can't stand still.
I just feel like I'm being pushed by something...
...
...
...
...7 PM...
Yuusaku: "...I've been waiting."
Chihiro: "I-I'm sorry for the intrusion."
Yuusaku: "What did you tell your husband?"
Chihiro: "...That I'm meeting a friend."
Yuusaku: "Well, that's a safe enough reason."
Chihiro: "...He looked a bit surprised."
Yuusaku: "Why?"
Chihiro: "Because I've never gone out while he's on a business trip..."
Yuusaku: "I was equally surprised."
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "Use less fabric softener."
Chihiro: "Ah... "
Yuusaku: "Don't leave your clothes as they are after washing them."
Chihiro: "Ah... "
Yuusaku: "I noticed the note, albeit late. This, your wife wrote it, didn't she?"
Chihiro: "Yes... that's right..."
Yuusaku: "I'm surprised you're giving laundry instructions to a man you should hate."
Chihiro: "I just couldn't help but worry..."
Yuusaku: "You're really a strange woman."
Chihiro: "I... I know I'm being strange."
Yuusaku: "Hmm..."
Your response is different from before.
I figured you would say with a sulky face that...
You're weird.
Yuusaku: "It seems you're really determined."
Chihiro: "If I wasn't, I wouldn't be here."
Yuusaku: "You're going to fix something you've been dragging along for more than ten years in just half a day. Are you confident you can follow me without complaining?"
Chihiro: "I... I am..."
But how...
My...
Yuusaku: "We're going to take down your uncle together."
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "To do that, all you have to do is the opposite of what caused it."
Chihiro: "I... I don't understand what you're saying."
Yuusaku: "You'll understand soon. But before that..."
First, your face
Yuusaku: "First, your face."
Chihiro: "My... face?"
Yuusaku: "Try to smile with ease."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "It's an exercise before the main event."
Chihiro: "Even if you tell me out of the blue..."
Yuusaku: "If you can't do even that, you can't expect to get better..."
Go home.
Chihiro: "I... I'll do it... a relaxed... smile..."
Yuusaku: "... "
Chihiro: "... A... relaxed... smile."
Yuusaku: "Where's the smile in that?"
Chihiro: "Please say something funny."
Yuusaku: "Are you stupid?"
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yuusaku: "It only makes sense if you can do it yourself."
Chihiro: "I can do it myself..."
Yuusaku: "Quickly."
Chihiro: "Uh, um... Shou-chan, baby... Shou-chan..."
Chihiro: "... "
Chihiro: "... "
Chihiro: "... "
Chihiro: "Smile..."
Yuusaku: "... "
Chihiro: "...How is it?"
Yuusaku: "It's a bit forced, but I guess that's how it is."
Chihiro: "I'm... I'm glad."
Yuusaku: "Then next..."
Imagine me as your uncle
Yuusaku: "Imagine me as your uncle without changing your expression."
Chihiro: "Huh...?"
Yuusaku: "Without changing your expression."
Chihiro: "Uh...I'm sorry."
Yuusaku: "Chihiro."
Chihiro: "Yes?"
Yuusaku: "You've grown up."
Chihiro: "Um, thanks to you."
Yuusaku: "...What the hell is that?"
Chihiro: "I, I couldn't think of anything else to say."
Yuusaku: "I'm your uncle, so you're the same Chihiro from back then. Would a child who hasn't even reached puberty say 'thanks to you'?"
Chihiro: "...You're right."
Yuusaku: "Chihiro."
Chihiro: "Yes?"
Yuusaku: "You've grown up."
Chihiro: "Well, last time we met was when I was in kindergarten."
Yuusaku: "Who am I?"
Chihiro: "...You're my uncle."
Yuusaku: "And you are?"
Chihiro: "I'm Chihiro, who got sent to the countryside for summer vacation."
Yuusaku: "Then greet me."
Chihiro: "Hello, uncle."
Yuusaku: "Hello."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "You've been coming to your uncle's house a lot, haven't you?"
Chihiro: "Ye, yes."
Yuusaku: "...You pass."
Chihiro: "...Thank... you..."
Yuusaku: "Next, with a relaxed smile..."
Say "pussy"
Say "I love dicks"
Yuusaku: "Say 'pussy.'"
Yuusaku: "Say 'I love dicks.'"
Chihiro: "Wha...?"
Yuusaku: "Didn't I say 'with a relaxed smile'?"
Chihiro: "But, why... for what reason...?"
Yuusaku: "I thought we agreed you wouldn't complain."
Chihiro: "But..."
Yuusaku: "One reason is I wanted to check if you could obey me."
Chihiro: "I... I will obey."
Yuusaku: "The other reason is I wanted to see if you could break out of your shell before the real thing."
Chihiro: "...Shell?"
Yuusaku: "To defeat your uncle, you can't remain as you've been. As a passive and obedient Chihiro, you can't win."
Chihiro: "I kind of... understand."
Yuusaku: "If you understand, then smile."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "...What will you do?"
Chihiro: "Uh...ah..."
Yuusaku: "Will you break the shell or stay hidden in it? Which one?"
Chihiro: "...Pussy."
Chihiro: "...I love dicks."
Yuusaku: "Huh..."
Chihiro: "I... I said it with a smile."
Yuusaku: "Say it again."
Chihiro: "Uh...pussy."
Chihiro: "Uh...I love dicks."
Yuusaku: "Next, answer my question."
Chihiro: "Ye, yes."
Yuusaku: "Are you good at fellatio?"
Chihiro: "Uh... I'm not good at it."
Yuusaku: "That answer is unacceptable."
Chihiro: "...Eh?"
Yuusaku: "Which Chihiro are you now?"
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "Let's try again."
Chihiro: "S-sorry."
Yuusaku: "...Your expression."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "Are you good at fellatio?"
Chihiro: "I don't know about fellatio."
Yuusaku: "So..."
What do you like to eat?
What are you good at in school?
Do you have a boy you like at school?
What do you usually do at home for fun?
Who do you usually take a bath with?
Chihiro's chest has gotten bigger, hasn't it?
You're already growing pubic hair, right?
What color do you like for your underwear?
Yuusaku: "What do you like to eat?"
Chihiro: "Uh, omelettes and hamburgers."
Yuusaku: "So..."
Yuusaku: "What are you good at in school?"
Chihiro: "Language, math... and music..."
Yuusaku: "What are you bad at?"
Chihiro: "Uh, physical education."
Yuusaku: "So..."
Yuusaku: "Do you have a boy you like at school?"
Chihiro: "...Yes."
Yuusaku: "What's his name?"
Chihiro: "Uh, Shindo-kun from my class..."
Yuusaku: "So..."
Yuusaku: "What do you usually do at home for fun?"
Chihiro: "I draw pictures, read books... various things..."
Yuusaku: "You're usually home alone, aren't you?"
Chihiro: "Yes."
Yuusaku: "That's why you came to play at your uncle's place."
Chihiro: "Th-that... might be..."
Yuusaku: "So..."
Yuusaku: "Who do you usually take a bath with?"
Chihiro: "Who... I usually bathe alone..."
Yuusaku: "What about your parents?"
Chihiro: "Uh, they told me to go ahead alone because if I wait for them, I'll go to bed late."
Yuusaku: "Then let's take a bath together today."
Chihiro: "U-uh... okay..."
Yuusaku: "...That's the spirit."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "Chihiro's chest has gotten bigger, hasn't it?"
Chihiro: "Uh, it's still small."
Yuusaku: "Small? How small is it?"
Chihiro: "It was 75 cm when I measured it at a physical examination."
Yuusaku: "What about the other girls?"
Chihiro: "Ev-everyone else is smaller."
Yuusaku: "So Chihiro is a busty girl."
Chihiro: "Uh, I think 'busty' is a word for when you're an adult."
Yuusaku: "...That's fine."
Chihiro: "Y-yes."
Yuusaku: "We're getting closer to certainty."
Chihiro: "Uh, I'll do my best."
Yuusaku: "So, has hair started growing down there yet?"
Chihiro: "N-No, not yet."
Yuusaku: "Even though your chest has started to develop?"
Chihiro: "Y-Yes."
Yuusaku: "So you're completely smooth."
Chihiro: "Sm-Smooth..."
Yuusaku: "So, the smooth part is covered by... "
Yuusaku: "What color underwear do you prefer?"
Chihiro: "I, I only have white ones."
Yuusaku: "Why?"
Chihiro: "Because that's all mom buys."
Yuusaku: "So you're wearing white today?"
Chihiro: "Y-Yes..."
Yuusaku: "Really?"
Chihiro: "Really."
Yuusaku: "...Are you sure?"
Chihiro: "Um, well..."
Yuusaku: "Really, is it white?"
Chihiro: "Ah, um..."
Yuusaku: "What's wrong?"
Chihiro: "I don't understand what you're asking for."
Yuusaku: "Where are you now?"
Chihiro: "...At Uncle's house."
Yuusaku: "It's not a house anymore, it's a barn."
Chihiro: "Eh..."
Yuusaku: "Are you planning to just wait and let anything happen to you again?"
Chihiro: "Uhh..."
Yuusaku: "Your uncle, who was standing, is slowly getting closer. Muttering whether your underwear is really white..."
Chihiro: "N-No..."
Yuusaku: "If you don't like it, do something about it."
Chihiro: "What should I do?"
Yuusaku: "You should do the opposite of what has been done to you. Show your panties to your uncle on your own, and mock the perverted old man."
Chihiro: "..."
Yuusaku: "It seems like you can't break out of your shell."
Chihiro: "Uncle..."
Yuusaku: "What?"
Chihiro: "If you doubt me that much... I-I'll show you."
Yuusaku: "Show me what?"
Chihiro: "M-My panties."
Yuusaku: "In what posture?"
Chihiro: "In a squatting position."
Yuusaku: "Don't say it while you're scared. Look down on me more."
Chihiro: "Uhh..."
Yuusaku: "You should talk down to me arrogantly."
Chihiro: "I can't do that."
Yuusaku: "Why not?"
Chihiro: "Because... Because..."
Yuusaku: "Are you still scared of your uncle?"
Chihiro: "...Nods."
Yuusaku: "If you're scared, you'll lose to your wife."
Chihiro: "If I resist, I'll get scolded... And he'll mess with me again..."
Yuusaku: "You came here to get rid of that mindset, didn't you?"
Chihiro: "I... I understand that. But it's not about logic."
Yuusaku: "What happened to the determination you had just now?"
Chihiro: "I... I could endure it at first, but it gradually became more and more frightening..."
Yuusaku: "That's proof that you were reverting to your old self."
Chihiro: "P... Please teach me."
Yuusaku: "...What?"
Chihiro: "Why... why would Uncle, do such terrible things to me..."
Yuusaku: "There are all kinds of people in the world."
Chihiro: "But he's a relative... he's my uncle... He knows it would hurt me... *sniffle*."
Yuusaku: "Crying alone won't remove the ingrained dirt."
Chihiro: "Since that incident, I've felt dirty. No matter how many times I take a bath, or scrub my body with soap, I always feel filthy..."
Yuusaku: "...If you've come here to whine, you can leave."
Chihiro: "You... you don't understand how I feel. How much I've suffered... how much I've agonized... but if I talk to someone about it..."
Chihiro: "I'm scared of Uncle... *sobs* I broke my promise... he'll definitely come to see me... this time he'll have sex with me..."
Yuusaku: "He won't come."
Chihiro: "He... he'll come when Shō isn't around."
Yuusaku: "How many years do you think have passed since then?"
Chihiro: "How am I supposed to know that!"
Yuusaku: "The guy you're afraid of isn't all that. He's just a piece of shit who deserves nothing but contempt and pity."
Chihiro: "*sob*... *hic*..."
Yuusaku: "Say 'piece of shit'."
Chihiro: "...Piece... of... shit..."
Yuusaku: "Again."
Chihiro: "P... Piece of shit..."
Yuusaku: "One more time."
Chihiro: "P... Piece of shit!"
Yuusaku: "Curse him with more anger. Make sure he never does the same thing again, hurt him thoroughly."
Chihiro: "You... you're the section manager, not Uncle."
Yuusaku: "Should I bring the real one then?"
Chihiro: "N... No."
Yuusaku: "Then superimpose the image, even if it's hard. I've done terrible things to you too, it should be easier than with some random guy, right?"
Chihiro: "Y... You're different from Uncle. It's true you did many terrible things to me, but I wasn't a little child anymore."
Yuusaku: "...I think we're pretty similar though."
Chihiro: "..."
Yuusaku: "If you're going to get back at him, now's the only time. Direct all your anger at the idiot who's ruined your life so far."
Chihiro: "Stupid... Uncle!"
Yuusaku: "...That's right."
Chihiro: "You tied up Auntie... pervert!"
Yuusaku: "Say more!"
Chihiro: "Why... why did you do that to me?"
Yuusaku: "...Because I thought you would endure it, Chihiro."
Chihiro: "Why did you do weird things with Auntie when I stayed over?"
Yuusaku: "...I couldn't help but want to show you, Chihiro."
Chihiro: "So... that's it."
Yuusaku: "You were excited even as a child, weren't you?"
Chihiro: "That's not something adults should do. It's clear that your intention from the start was to play a prank when you locked me in the barn when Auntie wasn't around."
Yuusaku: "Your Uncle couldn't help but love you, Chihiro. You were so cute, too cute."
Chihiro: "Not as a niece, but as an object of desire, right?"
Yuusaku: "Your Uncle likes hairless smooth private parts and budding breasts..."
Chihiro: "That's why you invited me to the bath."
Yuusaku: "Your angry face is cute too, Chihiro..."
Splat.
Chihiro: "D... don't come closer, Uncle!"
Yuusaku: "...I wonder what color Chihiro's panties are."
Chihiro: "If you want to know the color of my underwear that much..."
Yuusaku: "...If I want to know?"
Chihiro: "If you want to know... if you want to know..."
Yuusaku: "...Break the shell."
Snap.
Chihiro: "You... you can look all you want."
Yuusaku: "...Stay strong just like that."
Chihiro: "Ugh...ugh..."
Yuusaku: "If you behave obscenely, your mother will scold you."
Chihiro: "You... you planned to do this from the start."
Yuusaku: "Your Uncle likes to make you, who dislikes it, do it."
Chihiro: "Then I definitely won't close my legs."
Yuusaku: "Then your Uncle will..."
Jiggle.
Chihiro: "..."
Yuusaku: "..."
Good.
She lifted it up before I did.
Yuusaku: "...Why are you taking away your Uncle's pleasure?"
Chihiro: "Because... I want to get back at you."
Yuusaku: "Who's the naughty child peeping through the hole in the screen door?"
Chihiro: "If there was such a noise, anyone would peek."
Yuusaku: "I never thought Chihiro would make such an excuse..."
Chihiro: "Just tell me the color of my underwear already."
Yuusaku: "...White."
Chihiro: "You're satisfied now, right, Uncle?"
Yuusaku: "I might be more satisfied if I could touch..."
Chihiro: "If you touch me, I'll report you to the police."
Yuusaku: "Chihiro, you're too timid to do such a thing."
Chihiro: "No, not just the police. I'll tell Auntie too. I'll ruin the life of the uncle who tormented me."
Yuusaku: "...What's fun about troubling your uncle so much?"
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "Please, keep it a secret, Chihiro."
Chihiro: "Huh... uh..."
Yuusaku: "...I'm sorry, Chihiro."
Chihiro: "No, I won't forgive you. It's just words anyway."
Yuusaku: "I see, in that case..."
(The sound of a door opening.)
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "If you won't forgive me, I have no choice but to do this."
Chihiro: "Do whatever you want."
Yuusaku: "Thanks to you dressing so lewdly, look at me..."
(He touches himself.)
Chihiro: "Self-pleasuring is the worst. You're not regretful at all, Uncle."
Yuusaku: "It's not just self-pleasure, Chihiro."
(Sound of a camera shutter.)
Chihiro: "!!?"
Yuusaku: "I'm going to commemorate your beautiful appearance. Don't tell anyone about what I did."
Chihiro: "That... that's my... phone...?"
Yuusaku: "Say cheese."
Chihiro: "No, don't take pictures!"
(Sound of a camera falling.)
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yuusaku: "Ouch..."
Chihiro: "I'm... I'm sorry..."
Yuusaku: "Why are you apologizing?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yuusaku: "Keep pressing the shutter."
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "Now it's your turn to disgrace your uncle."
Chihiro: "But..."
(He continues to touch himself.)
Yuusaku: "Ugh..."
Chihiro: "Huh..."
Yuusaku: "Haah... haah... haah... uh..."
Chihiro: "Ah... uh..."
Yuusaku: "See, it's not often you see such a disgraceful sight."
Chihiro: "Doing something like that is stupid."
(Shutter sound.)
Yuusaku: "...Yes, it is."
Chihiro: "Aren't you embarrassed, being an adult?"
(Shutter sound.)
Chihiro: "You're all alone, making your penis hard, and furiously stroking it all by yourself..."
Click.
Yuusaku: "Haah... Haah... Uuh... Haah..."
Chihiro: "What a pitiful and pathetic sight, Uncle."
Yuusaku: "...Right?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yuusaku: "How old was Uncle again?"
Chihiro: "Probably a bit older than you..."
Yuusaku: "It's pretty disgraceful for someone his age, isn't it?"
Chihiro: "Yes, it's disgraceful."
Yuusaku: "So the man you were afraid of is just this level of good-for-nothing."
Chihiro: "...That might be the case."
Yuusaku: "He's just a coward who can't handle a grown woman."
Stroking noises.
Chihiro: "..."
Yuusaku: "Am I wrong?"
Chihiro: "I... I think he is a coward."
Yuusaku: "You've stopped taking pictures."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Click.
Chihiro: "Uncle, the coward."
Click.
Chihiro: "Doing such things to someone who can't fight back, Uncle is a cowardly, low, good-for-nothing..."
Yuusaku: "...You're right, Chihiro."
Chihiro: "..."
Yuusaku: "Uncle is a piece of trash."
Chihiro: "It's too late to say something like that now."
Click.
Chihiro: "Taking advantage of my weakness..."
Click.
Chihiro: "Taking so many strange photos..."
Click.
Chihiro: "And using them to threaten me is too cruel."
Click.
Chihiro: "Tell me why you targeted me."
Yuusaku: "Because I thought you'd do anything I told you to."
Chihiro: "Even for an adult like me?"
Yuusaku: "Uncle only knew the old Chihiro."
Chihiro: "I'm asking the current chief."
Click.
Chihiro: "Uncle, who is like a demon, raped me in front of my husband."
Yuusaku: "Huh..."
Chihiro: "If you don't answer, I'll..."
Yuusaku: "What will you do?"
Chihiro: "I'll post the embarrassing photos on the bulletin board of the apartment building. I'll make a big poster and go to the pool again, and post it in the toilet."
Yuusaku: "...Please don't do that."
Chihiro: "Then tell me."
Yuusaku: "The reason I targeted you was because you were beautiful."
Chihiro: "Don't joke with me."
Yuusaku: "Then, it was because your smile was lovely."
Click.
Chihiro: "Uncle, the liar."
Yuusaku: "I could say it's because your breasts are large."
Chihiro: "If that was the case, you could have just touched them. But you've been very cruel to me."
Yuusaku: "I like seeing you troubled, Chihiro."
Chihiro: "You thought if you bullied me, I'd comply obediently."
Yuusaku: "Exactly."
Chihiro: "But if you were only after my body, you could have taken it by force."
Yuusaku: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "Uncle, you deliberately took the long way around."
Yuusaku: "Well, I'm a coward too, aren't I?"
Chihiro: "That's a lie too."
Yuusaku: "Why?"
Chihiro: "You're not trembling at all."
Yuusaku: "I'm just putting on a brave face because I'm timid."
Stroking noises.
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "I've never seen a woman walk such a tightrope as you."
Chihiro: "Why did you choose me to bully?"
Yuusaku: "I don't know..."
Chihiro: "What I want to know is why."
Yuusaku: "Does it really matter?"
Chihiro: "It does."
Yuusaku: "What answer would satisfy you?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yuusaku: "Do you want praise? Or do you want to be criticized?"
Chihiro: "I don't particularly..."
Yuusaku: "Uncle's objective was only your body, Chihiro."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "Which means, there's no need to harbor any feelings other than contempt."
Chihiro: "That's why I can't accept it."
Yuusaku: "The conversation is going off the rails. What did you come here for?"
Chihiro: "It's not off topic because you're my Uncle. If I clearly understand the reason, I'm sure the strange fear will disappear."
Yuusaku: "You're wrong."
Chihiro: "I know myself better than anyone else."
Yuusaku: "More than me?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yuusaku: "What you need is the feeling of forgiving Uncle. Realize he's a man not even worth hating by witnessing his disgrace."
Yuusaku: "That way, the feelings of self-blame will naturally disappear. Of course, if you could insult Uncle enough to feel pity for him, that is."
Chihiro: "I can't do it anymore."
Yuusaku: "Don't give up so easily."
Chihiro: "I can't even tell who I'm blaming with this."
Yuusaku: "This is even better."
Stroking noises.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yuusaku: "You should blame both Uncle and me."
Chihiro: "You are not my trauma."
Yuusaku: "Might as well get it all over with."
Chihiro: "That was your aim from the beginning."
Yuusaku: "It's cleaner when both are gone."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "Come on, start insulting."
Stroking noise.
Yuusaku: "I look pathetic no matter how you look at it, right?"
Chihiro: "Yes, pathetic and the worst."
Yuusaku: "Indeed."
Stroking noises.
Chihiro: "Doing it yourself doesn't suit you."
Yuusaku: "A lonely middle-aged man is just like this."
Chihiro: "Then you should get married."
Yuusaku: "Uncle is already married."
Chihiro: "I was talking about you, Chief, not Uncle."
Yuusaku: "No one would marry a man like me."
Chihiro: "That's because you don't want to get married..."
Yuusaku: "Who would fall for a guy who exploits weaknesses and threatens people?"
Chihiro: "There must be some good points about you."
Yuusaku: "No, there aren't."
Chihiro: "You can't know that for sure."
Yuusaku: "This hasn't sounded like an insult for a while."
Chihiro: "But..."
Yuusaku: "Try saying, 'You're just like trash to me'."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "Say it."
Chihiro: "You're just like trash to me."
Yuusaku: "You're less significant to me than air."
Chihiro: "You're less significant to me than air."
Yuusaku: "A man not worth living."
Chihiro: "I can't say such a terrible thing."
Yuusaku: "There's no need to be considerate to trash."
Stroking noises.
Chihiro: "Hic..."
Yuusaku: "I apologize for being born into this world."
Chihiro: "You belittle yourself too much, Chief."
Yuusaku: "If I didn't exist, my wife could have lived normally."
Chihiro: "That's because I had a weakness too..."
Yuusaku: "You didn't do anything wrong."
Chihiro: "At least I had a chance to ask someone for help."
Yuusaku: "I'm the one who made that impossible. I took pictures and silenced you, just like Uncle..."
Chihiro: "..."
Yuusaku: "Including on behalf of Uncle, I'll apologize. In the most pathetic way fitting for a scumbag, you see..."
Stroking noises, then a tight squeeze.
Yuusaku: "I'm about to ejaculate soon, so take a picture of that moment with my face in it."
Chihiro: "No, no."
Yuusaku: "It'll be a shame that'll last for generations for a man."
Chihiro: "Please, stop it already."
Yuusaku: "Huff...haa...haa..."
Chihiro: "You shouldn't do such things to yourself."
Yuusaku: "It's fine for a scumbag like Uncle."
Squeeze.
Chihiro: "I'm talking about you, not Uncle."
Yuusaku: "...Let go of it."
Chihiro: "If you promise to stop stroking."
Yuusaku: "At the very least, your anxiety towards me will disappear. If you have a picture of me ejaculating, I definitely won't be able to do anything."
Chihiro: "We, we only need to deal with Uncle this time."
Yuusaku: "So, have you come to forgive Uncle?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yuusaku: "Then I have to expose an even more shameful and pathetic sight."
Chihiro: "Anyway, please consider things separately. It's unfair to lump everything together."
Yuusaku: "That's why I said we might as well."
Chihiro: "I can handle things that have happened since becoming an adult myself."
Yuusaku: "How?"
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Squeeze.
Yuusaku: "...You're squeezing too hard."
Chihiro: "Because you, Chief, are being unfair..."
Yuusaku: "...In what way?"
Chihiro: "You have no right to settle things. You're trying to make me forget everything by mixing up the issue with Uncle."
Yuusaku: "You're the one who mixed them up first."
Chihiro: "You also said it was convenient, Chief."
Yuusaku: "So we're both in agreement, then."
Chihiro: "I'm not in agreement at all."
Squeeze.
Yuusaku: "Ouch..."
Chihiro: "You deserve it."
Yuusaku: "What on earth do you want?"
Chihiro: "Tell me why you chose me."
Yuusaku: "Why are you so fixated on that?"
Chihiro: "You could answer me, couldn't you?"
Yuusaku: "...You're a persistent woman."
Squeeze.
Yuusaku: "Enough already."
Chihiro: "I'll keep applying pressure if you don't tell me."
Yuusaku: "If you don't want it all mixed up, just ask about Uncle."
Chihiro: "I don't care about Uncle anymore."
A tight squeeze.
Yuusaku: "Ouch, hey, that hurts."
Chihiro: "Tell me why you chose me."
Yuusaku: "Why do you ask about something you're trying to forget?"
Chihiro: "I, I won't forget. I'll remember it, absolutely."
Yuusaku: "...I don't want to go back to who I was before."
Chihiro: "I want to go back. But I don't want to be made to forget because of your selfish reasons."
Yuusaku: "What does that even mean?"
Chihiro: "That's why I absolutely..."
Yuusaku: "You will forget."
Chihiro: "I, I won't forget."
Yuusaku: "...You'll forget when the treatment is over."
Chihiro: "Why, why would you say something like that?"
Yuusaku: "Because I want to put an end to this."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yuusaku: "It's not something to cry about, you should be happy."
Chihiro: "But, but..."
Yuusaku: "It seems like the only adult parts about you are your breasts and pussy. You start crying at the drop of a hat."
Chihiro: "You, you're terrible..."
Yuusaku: "...Crybaby."
Chihiro: "If you want me to forget so badly, I'll forget after I get my revenge."
Yuusaku: "Go ahead."
Chihiro: "I'll forget on my own terms, not because of you."
Yuusaku: "So, go ahead."
Chihiro: "I'll take a lot of embarrassing photos of you... I'll make you go shopping with your pants off... I'll violate you in front of someone important to you."
...
From then on...
I cried a lot, even to the point of surprising myself.
I lost control of my emotions again.
I started sobbing without any care.
Why?
Who knows?
My pride was more shattered than when I was violated.
I was unbearably frustrated by his one-sided attitude.
Even so, I didn't let go of his penis.
Before I knew it, I was holding it tightly with both hands.
This act, not by reason but by instinct, was the most repulsive.
To be jerked off and made to ejaculate at his whim.
So I wrapped my hands around his...
I'm desperately holding it still so it wouldn't move.
I don't remember much from there.
Perhaps he provoked me with cruel words.
Or maybe, under the pretext of revenge, I did something myself.
My mind was spinning.
Tears were falling.
His penis was hard.
I felt like I was going crazy.
In fact, I was already crazy.
Eventually, I didn't know what had become of what.
In the situation where I was pretending to be confident, I...
Slurp... Slide...
Chihiro: "Ah... Uh..."
