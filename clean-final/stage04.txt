...The following day, at 3 p.m...
Yuusaku: "..."
Yuusaku: "...Ugh."
Damn it.
The convenience store lunch I ate at noon is still sitting in my stomach.
And then there's that jerk Akizuki.
As usual, he's got a homemade lunch.
Not a single pre-packaged item.
Everything is handmade.
Is he a model of a husband to be envied?
I guess so.
But that's only for now.
He better savor it while he can.
His happiness is as ephemeral as a castle built on sand.
In the near future, I'll be the one eating that lunch.
Pipopa… Pepo…
Rururururu…rururururu…rururururu….
Yuusaku: "..."
Click.
Chihiro: "...Hello?"
Yuusaku: "It's Zama."
Chihiro: "...!"
Yuusaku: "Thank you for always."
Chihiro: "N-no, thank you too..."
Yuusaku: "(Hehe...)"
She's struggling to act normal.
You're trying too hard, missus.
I can picture your bewildered face.
Yuusaku: "Have you thought about it?"
Chihiro: "...What are you talking about?"
Yuusaku: "It's obviously about the dinner invitation."
Chihiro: "I-I clearly rejected that."
Yuusaku: "Did you?"
Chihiro: "You're pretending not to know my answer..."
Yuusaku: "...Your answer?"
Chihiro: "B-because you're being vague..."
Yuusaku: "...I see."
Chihiro: "...!"
I deliberately create an unpleasant pause.
She's in a position where she has to choose her words carefully.
This silence must be distressing for her.
Chihiro: "Um..."
Yuusaku: "It seems like I'm disliked."
Chihiro: "It's not like that..."
Yuusaku: "It's just a dinner invitation."
Chihiro: "B-but, being asked alone is a bit..."
Yuusaku: "There's no problem if you get Akizuki's consent, right?"
Chihiro: "...I can't say something like that."
Yuusaku: "Why not?"
Chihiro: "I-it's absurd. Accepting such an invitation while being married..."
Yuusaku: "..."
An absurd story, huh.
You really want to say it's outrageous, don't you?
But you can't bring yourself to say it.
After all, I'm your beloved husband's boss.
The main matter has been confirmed directly from him.
A simple-minded guy like him.
He was probably overjoyed.
Thanks to that, the molestation and the underwear incident are vague.
Just as I thought.
Yuusaku: "I understand, Mrs. Akizuki."
Chihiro: "Wh-what do you mean?"
Yuusaku: "I won't invite you again."
Chihiro: "Ah... y-yes..."
Yuusaku: "So, say hello to Akizuki-kun for me."
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Click.
Yuusaku: "Hmph..."
This time, I hung up unilaterally.
It feels pretty good.
Ending the conversation while the other party is confused.
I can picture you right now.
My resigned words have not cleared your anxiety.
You're probably standing in the living room, still holding the receiver.
Especially that last parting shot.
That'll gradually sink in.
That's right.
I won't call you anymore.
Just wait and see.
You won't be able to stay still for long.
Yuusaku: "Hey, Akizuki!!"
Shouta: "Y-yes, Chief Zama?"
Yuusaku: "This needs to be done today."
Shouta: "Huh?"
I handed him a thick pile of documents.
The ones I've been accumulating in my drawer.
Normally, it would take three days to process them.
Yuusaku: "It's a rush job."
Shouta: "I-I understand."
Yuusaku: "..."
Akizuki, scurrying back to his desk.
This will be fun.
I'm getting excited.
If you realize the trap I've set, you win.
If not, you're going straight to hell.
Will you collapse first, or will your wife break first?
Well, I'm looking forward to seeing how it plays out.
...
...
...
Ding-dong.
Chihiro: "Coming."
Chihiro: "Welcome home."
Shouta: "...I'm home."
Chihiro: "You must be tired."
Shouta: "...Yeah."
Chihiro: "..."
It's 2 a.m.
He's never been this late before.
Even Shouta seems out of spirits.
He seems to be forcing a smile.
Chihiro: "I'll take your bag."
Shouta: "Thanks."
Chihiro: "..."
As usual, I line up the shoes.
Tomorrow is Sunday.
I was actually planning to ask Shouta to go shopping.
But he seems tired from work.
What should I do...?
Chihiro: "Shouta-kun."
Shouta: "What?"
Chihiro: "Do you want to eat first?"
Shouta: "Maybe I'll take a bath first today."
Chihiro: "Okay."
Shouta: "And, please make a light meal."
Chihiro: "...Why?"
Shouta: "Because it'll make me sleepy."
Chihiro: "???"
I don't understand what he means.
Shouta: "Actually, I couldn't finish my work... so I brought it home."
Chihiro: "Th-that's unusual, isn't it?"
Shouta: "I'll probably have to work on my day off tomorrow too."
Chihiro: "...Huh?"
Everything is a first for me.
I was a little bewildered.
Chihiro: "...You're that busy, huh."
Shouta: "Well, I am the company's hope after all."
Chihiro: "..."
The company's hope.
For some reason, the chief's words come to mind.
"Give my regards to Akizuki-kun."
It bothered me even after he hung up.
Because it was a strange way to say it.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
That's not good.
Shouta is already in the bath.
I need to have the meal ready as soon as he gets out.
Half the usual amount of side dishes?
I ponder this as I head to the kitchen.
The sink I'm used to.
The knife I'm holding is the same as always.
Nothing has changed.
But why?
I can't seem to calm down...
...
...
...
Chihiro: "..."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
A blanket had gently fallen to the floor.
Shouta must have put it on me.
The hands of the clock point to 7 a.m.
It's another sunny day.
The morning sun streaming through the gap in the curtains is dazzling.
It seems I fell asleep sprawled on the table.
Chihiro: "...?"
Where's Shouta?
The scattered documents were neatly tidied up.
In their place, a single note.
"I'm sorry for making you put up with this. I'll call you after noon."
Chihiro: "..."
I'm a little stunned.
He's already gone.
Earlier than his usual starting time.
Poor thing, even though it's Sunday.
I pull the chair out and slowly get up.
My body aches from sleeping while sitting.
But I can't afford to be idle.
He's working so hard.
I have to do my best too.
That's it.
I'll clean the house thoroughly today.
Every nook and cranny will sparkle.
The weather is nice, so I'll air out the futons.
Shouta probably stayed up all night.
So, tonight he must get a good night's sleep.
Otherwise, he'll ruin his health...
...
...
...
...Same day, 11 p.m...
Ding-dong.
Chihiro: "Coming."
Finally, he's back.
He didn't call me in the afternoon.
I was a little worried.
I rush to the entrance.
I plan to greet him with a beaming smile.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Shouta: "...I'm home."
Chihiro: "W-welcome back."
The beaming smile is nowhere to be seen.
My face must have shown my surprise.
Chihiro: "A-are you okay?"
Shouta: "What do you mean?"
Chihiro: "N-no... it's nothing..."
I decide to hold back on any further words that would feel like a blow.
He knows better than anyone how tired he is.
He moves to the living room without a word.
He doesn't even seem to have the energy to fake his cheerfulness.
Shouta: "...Chihiro."
Chihiro: "Y-yes?"
Shouta: "I don't need a bath or dinner tonight."
Chihiro: "W-why not?"
Shouta: "..."
He pointed at the bag I was holding.
Chihiro: "...Don't tell me, tonight too?"
Shouta: "I tried my best, but I couldn't finish. I have to get it done by Monday morning."
Chihiro: "..."
I'm at a loss for words.
This is too much, no matter how you look at it.
Chihiro: "Shouta."
Shouta: "Hmm?"
Chihiro: "Is this work... from the chief?"
Shouta: "Yeah."
Chihiro: "..."
The same words came to mind again.
"Give my regards to Akizuki-kun."
If you read too much into it, you could interpret it in any way.
Is it retaliation for turning down his advances?
But it's directed at Shouta, not me.
Chihiro: "..."
Could it be...
Absolutely
Could it be...
It's not impossible.
But I don't want to believe he's that bad.
That would be too pitiful for Shouta.
Above all, I don't want to negate his efforts with my own presumptions.
He's trying so hard, even working on his days off.
I have to think positively.
Absolutely.
This is not normal.
Shouta is suffering because of me.
I should help him
I'll be honest
I should help him.
That's the only thing that came to mind.
He's trying so hard, even working on his days off.
I don't want to waste his efforts.
I'll be honest about what I've been silent about until now.
That's the only thing that came to mind.
Chihiro: "I, actually, I have something I want to discuss with you..."
Shouta: "...Huh?"
Chihiro: "I'm sorry to bother you when you're tired."
Shouta: "Does it have to be today?"
Chihiro: "..."
His words are only natural.
I would say the same if the roles were reversed.
But...
Chihiro: "It might not be unrelated to what's happening now..."
Shouta: "...This situation?"
Chihiro: "..."
Shouta: "...What's going on?"
Shouta looks concerned at my serious expression.
He really is kind.
He's prioritizing me over his work now.
That's why I have to tell him properly.
Whether it's just my assumption or not, it's up to him to judge.
Chihiro: "You see..."
I looked straight into Shouta's eyes.
This isn't a light topic for him either.
So I'll explain it in an orderly and easy-to-understand way.
To get it all out in one go.
Chihiro: "I've been meaning to talk to you about this for a while now..."
Shouta: "Y-yeah."
About the time I saw his penis in the changing room.
In hindsight, even that was deliberate.
And the time I was molested on the way home from the cooking class.
When I received a call and was asked out for dinner.
When I found my dirty underwear hanging on the doorknob.
When the chief said to me, "Give my regards to Akizuki-kun."
Suppressing my emotions, I began to tell him each incident one by one.
Shouta: "..."
Shouta, who initially listened with a nod...
He eventually lost his words.
He just looked pale.
Shouta: "The... Chief Kazama did that?"
Chihiro: "..."
I nodded slowly.
That alone took all my energy.
Perhaps it's because I felt relieved after being able to talk.
Tears began to pour out like a dam had broken.
Chihiro: "I'm sorry for saying something like this when you're working so hard..."
Shouta: "Don't say such foolish things."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
His arm reached my back.
He hugged me tightly.
Shouta: "Why didn't you tell me sooner?"
Chihiro: "B-because, your work is important... and I didn't want to be a burden... even if I wasn't at fault, if something strange happened..."
Shouta: "Like getting fired?"
Chihiro: "..."
It's not an impossible scenario.
The chief's father is the head of the personnel department.
Shouta: "We can always find another job. But there's only one Chihiro in the world, right?"
Chihiro: "Uh..."
I closed my eyes as if to push the tears away.
Those words alone were enough.
All my fears and worries disappeared.
I'm glad I talked to him.
I'm glad he's the one holding me.
That's why I regret a little.
My attitude when I was molested.
I'm ashamed that I didn't resist more.
I made a strong vow in my heart.
This body is only for Shouta.
I'll never let anyone else touch me again...
...
...
...
Chihiro: "...I want to help you."
Shouta: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "I want to be of use to you, Shouta."
Shouta: "Chihiro, I can't rely on you."
Chihiro: "If it's my help, it's within your capacity, right?"
Shouta: "..."
He neither affirms nor denies.
He must be really desperate.
I rummaged through the drawers of the cabinet.
I pulled out the calculator I used when I was working.
Chihiro: "Work begins."
Shouta: "..."
He silently goes to the table.
Without loosening his tie, he begins to spread out the documents.
I'm right next to Shouta.
Thanks to watching him all night, I have a rough understanding of the procedures.
He has to write the characters.
So I'm the calculator.
That alone should save a lot of time.
Chihiro: "Let's eat when we finish."
Shouta: "Y-yeah."
Let's do our best.
No matter what the chief's intentions are.
Shouta's hard work towards his job.
I know that better than anyone else...
...
...
...
...The next day, 10 a.m...
Yuusaku: "Hey, Akizuki!!"
Shouta: "Y-yes, Chief Kazama."
Yuusaku: "What are you thinking?"
Shouta: "...What do you mean?"
Yuusaku: "You're still doing a half-assed job."
Shouta: "...Eh?"
He looks shocked.
He's staring at the documents spread out on the desk.
Yuusaku: "The second half is all messed up."
Shouta: "T-that's not possible..."
Yuusaku: "What comes after NO.108?"
Shouta: "U-um, 109."
Yuusaku: "And the 109th is blank, see."
I flip the problem page with the tip of my nose.
Yuusaku: "What happens when you make a mistake like this?"
Shouta: "T-the numbers after that all get shifted."
Yuusaku: "Right."
Shouta: "B-but I was very careful..."
Yuusaku: "What did you say?"
Shouta: "N-no, I mean..."
There it goes, his usual habit.
He's looking around nervously.
As soon as his voice gets a bit louder, he starts worrying about the eyes of others.
Yuusaku: "So you're saying it's not your mistake?"
Shouta: "N-no, that's not what I mean..."
Yuusaku: "Redo it."
Shouta: "Y-yes."
Yuusaku: "I thought so, but never mind."
Shouta: "Eh?"
Yuusaku: "Forget it."
Shouta: "B-but..."
Yuusaku: "You don't have to attend the deputy chief's meeting tomorrow."
Shouta: "..."
Yuusaku: "Well, say hello to your wife for me."
Shouta: "Eh?"
Yuusaku: "Just go, come on."
Shouta: "...Understood."
Yuusaku: "..."
Yuusaku: "...Hmph."
You've lost.
Go home early today, and suck on your beloved wife's large breasts.
Tell her about how much you're hurt.
Get comforted by your lovely wife as much as you want.
Poor Shouta.
Unrewarded Shouta.
The more you get worried, the better.
That's the only role you, who is useless, have been given.
...
...
...
Ding-dong.
Chihiro: "Coming!"
Chihiro: "Welcome home."
Shouta: "I-I'm home."
Chihiro: "You were able to come home early today."
Shouta: "Yeah, well...a bit..."
Chihiro: "...?"
Something seems off.
Is it because he's tired?
After all, the documents were finished when it was already dawn.
He took a nap for about three hours and then went to work.
Monday morning.
He should've been able to meet the deadline mentioned by the Section Chief.
So, I thought he'd come home a little more cheerfully...
Chihiro: "...What's wrong?"
Shouta: "What do you mean?"
Chihiro: "..."
I should stop asking.
I'm being too nosy.
Chihiro: "I made your favorite today, Shanghai stir-fried noodles."
Shouta: "...Sorry."
Chihiro: "Eh?"
Shouta: "I don't have an appetite..."
Chihiro: "..."
The clock shows 8 PM.
Even though he managed to come home early.
Even though I thought we could have dinner facing each other.
I let out a small sigh, making sure he doesn't notice.
But it can't be helped.
I'll let him get a good night's sleep today.
If he does that, I'm sure he'll feel better.
Shouta: "Haaa...ah..."
Without even taking off his tie, he slumps onto a chair.
In stark contrast to me, he lets out a big sigh.
His face looks a little pale.
I wonder what's wrong.
While worried, my hand reaches for his bag.
As I always do, I tried to only take out the lunch box.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
A heavy weight.
He didn't eat at all.
Chihiro: "...Shouta?"
Shouta: "Hm?"
Chihiro: "...You didn't eat."
Shouta: "Sorry."
Chihiro: "Ah, you don't have to apologize... I'm just worried..."
Shouta: "...Sorry."
Chihiro: "..."
All he does is apologize repeatedly.
I ended up not being able to say anything.
Something's definitely not right.
Shouta: "...I'm really sorry..."
Chihiro: "No, it's okay... don't worry about it."
Shouta: "..."
I think it's better to leave him alone for now.
That's what my instinct tells me, not logic.
...
He returns to the table.
He stares blankly at the ceiling.
I put the lunch box back in the refrigerator.
It'll probably turn into food waste, but it feels wasteful to throw it away right away.
There have been times when he left about half of it.
But never untouched.
It's a strange feeling.
Like the gears have started to rust.
It's scary.
The weight of the lunch box in my hand feels less than the ominous feeling I have.
...
Shouta: "Ugh..."
Chihiro: "..."
Shouta: "...It's no good."
Chihiro: "There's no need to rush."
Shouta: "Ah..."
Chihiro: "You're just tired, right, Shouta?"
His penis is limp.
Even so, he desperately tried to penetrate.
Of course, it wasn't because I was begging him.
Ideally, I wanted him to sleep and rest his body as soon as possible.
I was genuinely thinking about that.
Chihiro: "Let's sleep for today."
Shouta: "Why do you say that?"
Chihiro: "..."
Shouta had a sad look on his face.
He seemed to be desperately searching for a foothold.
It's certain that he had a rough time at work.
That, too, can cause mental damage.
And it affects his physical condition immediately.
Was it because of the document he finished yesterday?
Was he scolded by his boss?
But I don't really know.
He hasn't told me anything yet.
Chihiro: "..."
That's okay.
Let's continue.
I'll cooperate with anything for him.
If sex makes him feel better, I wouldn't mind doing any kind of act.
Chihiro: "Shouta."
Shouta: "W-wait a little longer."
Chihiro: "I'll make it bigger with my mouth."
Shouta: "...Eh?"
*Slurp*...
Shouta: "Chihiro, you don't like that kind of thing, right?"
Chihiro: "I don't dislike it... it's just embarrassing."
Shouta: "..."
It wasn't a lie.
It's truly just embarrassing.
Even though everyone does it, I feel strangely shy.
I feel like I'm a very lewd woman.
So, he also cares about me and doesn't ask for it much.
It's my shortcoming.
I have to be more lewd for him.
*Slurp*... *slurp*...
Shouta: "Ugh..."
Chihiro: "Hmm... slurp."
Shouta: "Chihiro..."
Chihiro: "..."
His fist tightens...
It's as if to encourage himself.
What Shouta was desperately seeking...
I somehow understood.
Whether it's sex or anything else...
He just wants to regain his confidence.
Chihiro: "Mmm... slurp... slurp..."
Shouta: "Ugh..."
Shouta's body twitches.
But his penis remained flaccid.
It didn't get bigger at all.
Is it because I'm not good at this?
Shouta: "...damn it."
Chihiro: "..."
Shouta: "...damn it...damn it..."
Frustration over not getting an erection?
No.
I don't think that's what it is now.
That's why I silently continued to caress him.
I'm putting all my love into it.
Shouta: "...Chihiro."
Chihiro: "Hmm...Hmm...What is it?"
Shouta: "I was scolded in front of everyone."
Chihiro: "...Yeah."
Shouta: "Even though I worked hard, staying up all night for days... Even though you helped me..."
Chihiro: "..."
It seems he's finally ready to talk.
I'm glad for that.
But because of that, his body started to shake slightly.
He must have been really upset.
Poor thing.
Shouta: "It's impossible, a blank page."
Chihiro: "...A blank page?"
Shouta: "One of the documents was missing."
Chihiro: "What!?"
I was quite surprised.
The movement of my caressing tongue stopped for a moment.
Chihiro: "Don't tell me you have to redo it?"
Shouta: "They said they're going to ask someone else."
Chihiro: "..."
Shouta: "They said I don't have to attend the deputy chief's meeting. I probably won't get the recommendation for the chief position either."
Chihiro: "No...way..."
Shouta: "It must have been the chief's mistake to forget to hand it over."
Chihiro: "..."
Indeed, a blank page is impossible.
We paid so much attention to it.
The chief's forgetfulness.
It may be as Shouta says.
...
No.
Even though I had a much worse reason in mind.
There was more than enough evidence to make me think that way.
On purpose.
That's the first word that came to mind.
But...
Chihiro: "...I'm sorry."
Shouta: "For what?"
Chihiro: "If I had noticed the missing number..."
Shouta: "It's the chief's fault for not checking before handing it over."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Shouta's irritation.
He seems to not know where to direct his anger.
He roughly pushed me down on purpose.
With his soft penis, he tried to insert it into my vagina again.
Shouta: "...It won't go in."
Chihiro: "Let's calm down a bit...okay?"
Shouta: "It's not getting hard at all."
Chihiro: "Try to remember something fun."
Shouta: "...The chief's face is stuck in my head, it's impossible."
Chihiro: "Then, remember the time you were praised."
Shouta: "By the chief?"
Chihiro: "Yes."
Shouta: "That was probably the first and last time."
Chihiro: "If you work hard, there will be times when you'll be praised again."
Shouta: "...It won't come."
*Slip*...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
His penis is even more deflated.
It's become small like a bagworm.
Shouta: "Damn section manager."
Chihiro: "...Eh?"
Shouta: "That guy, he should just die."
Chihiro: "..."
That's not okay.
Don't say things like that.
It's not like Shouta.
Shouta: "What does 'give my regards to your wife' mean..."
Chihiro: "!?"
Shouta: "At the end, he said it to me with a sarcastic tone."
Chihiro: "Is...that so..."
Shouta: "He probably thinks that it's because of our newlywed haze."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
He distanced himself from me.
He lied down on the futon with an indifferent attitude.
Chihiro: "...Shouta-kun?"
Shouta: "..."
He remains silent, with his back turned towards me.
This is the first time I've seen him act so childishly.
It seems he's given up on sex.
I gently place a towel blanket on my body.
I then move from the Japanese-style room to the living room.
Chihiro: "..."
It's definitely my fault.
At least, I'm not unrelated.
I was convinced by the words from before.
"Give my regards to your wife"
It's a roundabout message to me.
I can't think of anything else.
What should I do?
At this rate, Shouta-kun will continue to suffer.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
No.
I shouldn't rush things at a time like this.
It's taboo to decide things on my own.
I need to make things clearer.
I need to confirm whether it's my imagination or not...
...The same day, 11 p.m...
Yuusaku: "..."
Yuusaku: "Tsk, it's you again."
I fast-forward the DVD abruptly.
Display the name of the male actor on the package.
A long-haired handsome man.
When you appear, my dick shrinks.
Is it a request from the actress?
Like I care.
You're supposed to serve the customers.
Don't underestimate the money public servants pay.
The actress is no better.
What's with those color blindness test-like panties?
Mixing red, black, and yellow.
Are you a poisonous moth from South America?
Damn it.
Ring ring... ring ring...
Yuusaku: "..."
Who is it at this hour?
Sacred masturbation time.
The idiot who interrupts should go to hell.
Yuusaku: "...Yes?"
Chihiro: "I'm sorry for calling at this hour."
Yuusaku: "..."
This is surprising.
Chihiro: "...I'm Akizuki's wife."
Yuusaku: "I can tell by the sound of your voice."
Chihiro: "My husband is always indebted to you..."
Yuusaku: "Did you call just to say that?"
I respond curtly on purpose.
It's important to impress her with our hierarchical relationship.
Chihiro: "No, well, um..."
Yuusaku: "And how's Akizuki-kun doing?"
Chihiro: "...He's already asleep."
Yuusaku: "Well, that's fine. So, what do you need?"
Chihiro: "I would like to accept an invitation to dinner..."
Yuusaku: "Really now..."
Well, well.
Is she already waving the white flag?
Yuusaku: "Tomorrow at 8 p.m."
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "Come to my place."
Chihiro: "Wha... what...?"
Yuusaku: "You send New Year's cards and stuff, so you know my address, right?"
Click.
Yuusaku: "..."
In times like these, it's best to keep it short.
It's better not to babble on too much.
She might change her mind while we're talking.
But it's startling how quick this was.
It's been about a week since I set my sights on her.
Isn't this a new record?
It's surprising how understanding she is.
She might be the loose type.
Maybe she partied a lot in the past.
Well, whatever.
A trivial woman with nothing but looks.
If that's the case, I'll treat her accordingly...
...
......
.........
