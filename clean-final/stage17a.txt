...A few days later...
Shota: "Ka, Section Chief."
Yusaku: "What is it?"
Shota: "Um, I'll help out too once it hits 9 o'clock, so please leave Chihiro to it until then."
Yusaku: "...Alright."
Yusaku: "You need to finish that document. The meeting the day after tomorrow is an important negotiation, not just for the budget department, but for the entire city hall."
Shota: "I, I understand."
Yusaku: "I should be the one doing that job. But to create something straight and true, it's better to leave it to one talent rather than many."
Shota: "I'll do my best to meet your expectations."
But that's a different story from doing the dishes...
Yusaku: "I've enjoyed your hospitality up until dinner, and now I'm relying on your talent. I'd be cursed if I didn't do a single dish."
Shota: "Ye, yes..."
Yusaku: "Your wife is going through a tough time right now, isn't she? I don't know much about morning sickness, but it seems that water-related housework can be quite difficult."
Shota: "I'm sorry for causing you trouble."
Yusaku: "Well, just because you help with the dishes once, it doesn't mean your wife will be completely saved."
I let out a dry laugh on purpose.
Pretending to let my eyes wander in self-mockery.
For just a moment, I glanced down.
Yusaku: "But it's a surprise that she's pregnant all of a sudden."
Shota: "I, I was planning to report it earlier..."
Yusaku: "Essentially, it's a matter between a husband and wife. I don't mind at all."
Shota: "I'm, I'm grateful."
That's when Akizuki lifted his head with a pop.
As if remembering something, he looked around nervously.
His small-minded personality was unchanged, and his face started to look quite anxious.
Shota: "Um, where is Chihiro?"
Yusaku: "Is something wrong with your wife?"
Shota: "She was next to you until a moment ago..."
Yusaku: "...She was doing the dishes with me, wasn't she?"
Shota: "Ye, yes."
Yusaku: "She's crouching down, wiping the floor now."
Shota: "Wiping the, floor?"
Yusaku: "I probably didn't wash the dishes well. I thought I was being careful, but it seems I splashed some unnecessary water."
Shota: "Ah, I see..."
Yusaku: "Was it more trouble than help?"
Shota: "No, not at all. It's really helpful."
Yusaku: "...I'm glad to hear that."
I smiled smugly.
This time, I did not even pretend to look away.
I naturally cast my gaze downward.
Yusaku: "I'm sorry for making extra work for you, ma'am."
Chihiro: "Nngh... No, it's... okay..."
Nurun...
Chihiro: "...Thank you... but... I'm fine."
Shota: "Doesn't crouching put a strain on your stomach?"
Chihiro: "I'm on my knees, so it's okay."
Shota: "I, is that so?"
Perhaps he felt relieved after hearing my voice.
Even though he was muffled, his voice became cheerful.
Chihiro: "Sh, Shota, continue your work."
Shota: "...Okay."
Chihiro: "After I finish wiping the floor, I'll make tea for you."
Shota: "Thanks."
Yusaku: "Akizuki, you're really lucky."
Shota: "...Huh?"
Yusaku: "I think it's rare to have such a perfect wife."
Shota: "I, I think so too."
Yusaku: "If you think so, you must appreciate it."
Shota: "Y, yes..."
Yusaku: "If you keep taking her for granted, she might run away."
Shota: "I, I will absolutely prevent that from happening."
Yusaku: "...Hear that, ma'am?"
Chihiro: "...!"
Section Chief looking down at me.
His eyes are both gentle and terrifying.
Like a child being scolded by a parent.
He's probably half joking.
But just being looked at makes me feel small.
I'm sorry for neglecting your penis.
Please forgive me, I'll lick it properly.
Hmmp...
Yusaku: "Kuu..."
Nurun...
Chihiro: "Wh, what?"
Shota: "Isn't there anywhere you want to go?"
Chihiro: "Do, do you mean come?"
Shota: "I'm talking about a trip."
Chihiro: "Ah, yeah... umm... well..."
I'm all aflutter.
I inadvertently let slip something with a strange meaning.
I'm flustered, even more than I can believe.
Chihiro: "Th, there's no particular place I want to go..."
Shota: "You must have at least one place in mind if you think about it."
Chihiro: "I think it's more important to rest Shota's body than to go on a trip..."
Yusaku: "...You're as kind as ever."
Gyu...
Chihiro: "Eee...!"
Chief's fingers on my chest.
He doesn't grope but finds the tip of my breast.
He pinches the bud with just enough strength.
Yusaku: "You mustn't hold back at times like this."
Chihiro: "Y, yes."
Shota: "A place where Chihiro would be happy on a trip..."
Chihiro: "On the contrary, isn't there a place you want to go, Shota?"
Shota: "Hm?"
Chihiro: "A place you want to go."
Shota: "If I decide, it won't feel like a show of gratitude."
Chihiro: "That's not true."
Shota: "If we're going to go, I want it to be a place Chihiro likes."
Chihiro: "No, I want it to be a place we both want to go."
Shota: "Really?"
Chihiro: "Because it's a trip we're going on together."
Shota: "I see..."
Even though I can't see his face...
He seems somewhat convinced.
Shota: "Then, then..."
Chihiro: "Yes?"
Shota: "I think a place where we can interact with nature would be nice."
Chihiro: "I agree."
Shota: "Maybe a beautiful beach."
Chihiro: "Just looking at it would be fun, I think."
Shota: "Or a mountain with clean air."
Chihiro: "That would be nice too."
Shota: "How about a leisurely hot spring?"
Chihiro: "Yes, I agree."
Shota: "How about going all out and heading to a tropical island?"
Chihiro: "As long as it suits your schedule, Shota."
Shota: "Something's off."
Chihiro: "Eh?"
Shota: "It feels like you're just agreeing with me."
Chihiro: "That's not really the case..."
Shota: "But all you're doing is agreeing."
Yusaku: "If she's traveling with you, she'd be happy anywhere."
Shota: "Huh?"
Yusaku comes to the rescue.
I didn't mean to be noncommittal...
But honestly, I've been distracted by the thing in front of me.
Yusaku: "Right, Mrs.?"
Chihiro: "Ah... Yes."
Yusaku: "If you can go on a trip with your husband, the place doesn't really matter, right?"
Chihiro: "... That might be... true..."
Shota: "Really?"
Chihiro: "Yes."
Shota: "Hehe."
Chihiro: "..."
Shota's happy voice.
I don't have to see his face to know what kind of expression he's making.
Innocent like a child...
It's that smile I love.
Chihiro: "Hm...ng..."
Yusaku: "...Oops."
Chihiro: "Ugh...cough...cough..."
Shota: "What happened?"
Chihiro: "Nothing."
Shota: "You were coughing before too..."
Chihiro: "Sorry for making you worry..."
Yusaku: "Are you okay, Mrs.?"
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku's gaze falls on my mouth.
His words of concern probably don't mean anything.
He must be intending something else.
Chihiro: "(Ah...)"
I understood.
He wanted me to say something.
That's why his gaze was not on my eyes, but on my mouth.
But, what?
Chihiro: "..."
I replayed our conversation as much as I could remember.
Tracing back to the memory right before I choked.
Thanks to that, my focus was taken away from his... part.
Finally, the puzzle pieces fell into place.
Chihiro: "Sh, Sho-chan."
Shota: "What?"
Chihiro: "I, I also think the hot spring there is good."
Shota: "Really?"
Chihiro: "I've been thinking so while listening to the conversation."
Shota: "I see."
Chihiro: "I don't like crowded places either..."
Yusaku: "You're going to decide the destination just like that?"
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Yusaku: "Choosing a place just because it's deserted seems a bit..."
Chihiro: "..."
Oh?
Did I say something off?
Chihiro: "B, but the food is delicious, as Manager said..."
Yusaku: "...Your home-cooked meals are unbeatable, ma'am."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yusaku's gaze became a bit harsher.
But still, I barely managed to not look away.
I desperately tried to understand the true meaning of this situation.
Yusaku: "..."
I didn't make a mistake.
I've said exactly what he wanted me to say.
That much was clear from looking into Yusaku's eyes.
Even my indecisive self was able to be sure of that.
The one being blamed is not the current me...
But the me from a little while ago who was spacing out without reading the room.
Chihiro: "..."
I'm sorry for being slow to react.
I'm sorry for missing the timing.
With that apology in my heart...
I anxiously waited like a criminal awaiting judgement.
Yusaku: "I've said it multiple times, but today's stew was really..."
Gyuu...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Again, the nipple.
This time, it was pinched directly.
Yusaku: "...delicious."
Chihiro: "Th, thank you."
Yusaku: "I wonder if thicker daikon radishes taste better."
Chihiro: "Ah, no... the thickness is... not really..."
Gyuuu...
Chihiro: "Ow..."
Yusaku: "..."
Chihiro: "...The thicker ones are... tastier."
Yusaku: "What about smooth ones and rough ones?"
Chihiro: "P, probably the rough ones..."
Yusaku: "So, you like thick and rough, ma'am."
Chihiro: "...Yes, I do."
Yusaku: "Why do you like it?"
Chihiro: "Wh, why you ask..."
Yusaku: "..."
I know.
I know what answer he wants.
Chihiro: "The thicker ones... feel... better..."
My voice was as faint as a mosquito's hum.
It's so quiet I could barely hear myself.
Most of it was drowned out by the sound of running water.
Yusaku: "By the way, what about the skin?"
Chihiro: "Th, the skin?"
Yusaku: "How do you peel the skin?"
Chihiro: "N, normally with a knife..."
Yusaku: "For anything other than daikon?"
Chihiro: "M, mostly with a knife and a peeler."
Yusaku: "And what about... dicks?"
Chihiro: "Wh, wait..."
This time, Manager-san whispered quite audibly.
Still, it made me break out in a cold sweat.
My heart felt like it was about to leap out of my chest.
Chihiro: "Y, your skin is already peeled back, Manager-san..."
Yusaku: "And what about your beloved husband's?"
Chihiro: "Wh, when he was little... it wasn't peeled back..."
Yusaku: "So, what would you do then, ma'am?"
Chihiro: "...I, I would sometimes peel it back with my hand..."
Yusaku: "How so?"
Chihiro: "Sl, slide it with my finger..."
Yusaku: "...I see."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Manager-san is definitely mean.
But, if we're talking about the root of the problem, it's me.
I forgot the favor of having my trauma lessened.
This is the punishment for sucking his... part thoughtlessly.
Yusaku: "Akizuki."
Shota: "Huh?"
Yusaku: "Were you listening properly?"
Shota: "Wh, what to?"
Yusaku: "Obviously to the talk about peeling skin."
Shota: "Sk, skin?"
Yusaku: "Whether it's daikon or anything else, getting used to things is key, that's the point."
Shota: "Uh, okay..."
Sho-chan responds ambiguously.
My worries were probably needless.
It seems we'll avoid the worst-case scenario.
But the relief makes me feel a little guilty.
Still, I can't directly apologize.
The feelings of wanting to apologize make me a bit chatty.
Chihiro: "I, it's exciting, isn't it?"
Shota: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "Th, the hot spring trip."
Shota: "Yeah... but..."
Chihiro: "...But?"
Shota: "Is it okay to decide on that place from earlier?"
Chihiro: "If you agree, Sho-chan."
Shota: "Of course, I agree but..."
He hasn't finished wiping yet.
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Shota: "...The floor."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Shota: "This seems way too long..."
Chihiro: "I, I thought I might clean up while I'm squatting down here."
Shota: "...Where?"
Chihiro: "The shelf under the sink."
Shota: "...Hmm."
Chihiro: "..."
I'm surprised.
I'm flustered by the unexpected check...
Even though he can't see my face from his position.
I feel like my agitation is about to be exposed by the trembling of my voice.
Shota: "Then what about the tea?"
Chihiro: "Just a little longer, please."
Shota: "Until you're done cleaning?"
Chihiro: "Y, yes."
Shota: "I think you don't need to clean up now."
Chihiro: "I need to do this kind of thing when I notice it."
Shota: "Even if that's the case..."
His voice volume drops at the end of his sentences...
And it's about to be drowned out by the sound of water.
Shota: "...I could help you when I'm available."
Chihiro: "..."
Shota: "...You've been by the manager's side all this time."
Chihiro: "I'm not doing it consciously..."
Shota: "..."
Chihiro: "..."
It's impossible.
Sandwiched between the two...
I'm overwhelmed by a sense of guilt I can't handle.
Something seeping out makes my lower body tingle.
Chihiro: "Ah...uh..."
I'm too perverted.
That's why it's throbbing the most ever.
I can feel the dripping wetness on my inner thigh...
And the thin cloth sticks to my flesh...
Chihiro: "Hmm...uh..."
Yusaku: "Hmm..."
Splurt, splurt, splurt, splurt, splurt...
Chihiro: "Uh...p...uh..."
Splurt, spurt, spurt, spurt, spurt...spurt...
Chihiro: "Mmm...g...uh...hah..."
Yusaku: "This is...my way of thanking you..."
Chihiro: "Ugh...gulp... I should be thanking you..."
Slosh... drip...
Chihiro: "Mmm...gulp...thank you for the meal... it was...lovely..."
Yusaku: "You heard that, Akizuki."
Shota: "Huh?"
Yusaku: "She said it was lovely."
Shota: "???"
Yusaku: "...She really is a capable wife."
Shota: "Uh, yes..."
Chihiro: "..."
I swallow, making a sound in my throat.
I gulped down the semen, which was like egg white.
I dribbled a little from my mouth...
But the extraordinary amount of discharge was too much to swallow in one gulp.
Chihiro: "Mm...uh..."
Yusaku: "Hehe..."
He slightly lifts the corner of his lips.
The manager is looking down at my face.
His expression holds a slight smile.
It's the same manager after tormenting me.
But I am different.
Even after everything has settled, I can't calm down...
And I can only look up at him with teary eyes.
Why is that?
When I received treatment from the manager.
When I took on the role of the bad guy on the train.
And when we had sex in the toilet afterwards.
At least I was able to be honest...
And I could express my feelings to the manager.
Surely it was because it was just the two of us...
With nothing in between.
But it's not the same now.
The manager doesn't allow us to be alone.
He deliberately humiliates me with fellatio next to Shota.
On top of that, he intentionally creates a precarious situation...
And he even tries to impose a risk with no escape.
Chihiro: "..."
It's scary.
What lies ahead for me.
A place I wouldn't want to get close to.
I feel like I'm being pushed there more and more.
And the more uncertain it is,
The more my uneasy feelings grow...
...
