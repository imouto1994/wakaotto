...The next day, 11:00 AM...
Yuusaku: "Hey, Akizuki!!"
Shouta: "Y-yes, Section Chief Kazama."
Yuusaku: "Show me your cell phone."
Shouta: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "Just show it to me."
Shouta: "Ah... Y-yes..."
Yuusaku: "...It seems pretty well-used."
Shouta: "W-well, it has been about 3 years..."
Yuusaku: "Hmm."
I grin.
I'm fiddling with his phone.
Yuusaku: "Did you know when you get promoted, your cell phone becomes company-owned?"
Shouta: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "Congratulations."
Shouta: "Huh... huh...?"
Yuusaku: "You've been promoted to the position of Chief Clerk, here."
Shouta: "..."
Yuusaku: "What's with that blank look?"
Shouta: "N-no... it's just that..."
Yuusaku: "If you think it's a lie, read it for yourself."
Shouta: "Budget Compilation Division, Mr. Shouta Akizuki..."
Yuusaku: "That's you, isn't it?"
Shouta: "The undersigned is appointed as the chief of the Budget Compilation Division of the Financial Bureau... The position is Chief Clerk."
Yuusaku: "...That's what it says."
Shouta: "S-section Chief..."
Yuusaku: "Later, make sure to greet the Deputy Director."
Shouta: "Y-yes."
Yuusaku: "If you understand, then you can go."
Shouta: "T-thank you very much!!"
Yuusaku: "..."
Yuusaku: "Leaving your important promotion letter on my desk, huh."
Well, it's fine.
It's proof that he's overwhelmed.
Rise, rise.
As high as the sky.
From now on, there's no denying that he'll be plunged into hell.
And when that happens, your wife will prepare herself.
Right?
That it's your fault that this idiot is getting hurt.
That it's your fault that your husband's efforts are going to waste.
You're more afraid of these two things than anything else.
No more ups and downs.
From now on, I'll take that part and turn it against you.
Then even preparing yourself will be impossible.
I was convinced of that with the words you said as you left.
"I don't want to cause trouble for my husband because of me."
I was frankly surprised.
Where did the issues of underwear and molestation go?
Before I knew it, you were blaming yourself.
In other words, it's not me who's driving your wife into a corner.
Her too-devoted feelings for her husband are strangling her...
...
...
...
Well then...
Chihiro: "..."
Chihiro: "*sigh*"
When I came out of the toilet, I had a staring contest with the second hand.
10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds...
Just one minute feels incredibly long.
Chihiro: "Ahh..."
No good after all.
The red-purple line is starting to darken.
This is the third pregnancy test.
The results are all the same.
What should I do?
I gently stroke my belly over my clothes.
Is there a baby?
Really?
Ring ring ring...
Chihiro: "Ah!"
Stop it.
Don't startle me.
Chihiro: "...Hello?"
Shouta: "Chi...Chihiro?"
Chihiro: "Ah..."
It's Shouta.
His voice is full of surprise.
Shouta: "It's, it's serious."
Chihiro: "What, what happened?"
Shouta: "I, I got promoted to section chief today."
Chihiro: "..."
Oh no...
I need to react more.
Chihiro: "Tha... that's amazing, Shouta."
Shouta: "Right?"
Chihiro: "Congratulations."
Shouta: "Thanks."
Chihiro: "..."
He sounds truly happy.
It even brings a smile to my face.
Shouta: "I wanted to tell you before anyone else. I tried to call you a few times during lunch break, but you were out."
Chihiro: "I'm sorry for making you call so many times."
Shouta: "Were you out?"
Chihiro: "Yeah, I took the train to the pharmacy in the next town."
Shouta: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "Are you likely to get home early today?"
Shouta: "I'm trying to. I want to celebrate with you too."
Chihiro: "...I'm glad."
Shouta: "Are you okay?"
Chihiro: "Okay? What do you mean?"
Shouta: "You seem a bit different than usual..."
Chihiro: "..."
Thank you.
For always caring about me.
Chihiro: "I'll talk to you when you get home."
Shouta: "O... okay."
Chihiro: "I'm not feeling ill or anything, so don't worry."
Shouta: "...understood."
...
Click.
Once I'm sure he's hung up, I gently put the receiver down.
About the baby.
I still can't bring myself to tell him over the phone.
I want to look at Shouta's face and tell him.
I wonder if he'll be happy.
At least it wasn't planned.
Honestly, I'm scared of how he'll react.
...
...
...
...Later that day, 8 PM...
Ding dong.
Chihiro: "Com... coming!"
He's finally home.
I rush to the front door like an excited puppy.
After hanging up with Shouta...
I've been feeling nervous.
I want him to know as soon as possible.
I regret not telling him earlier.
The feeling of wanting to tell him is growing bigger than my anxiety.
Chihiro: "I... I'll open it right away."
Yuusaku: "...I'm home."
Chihiro: "Welcome... home..."
My body stiffens.
Yuusaku: "Sorry for suddenly barging in, Madam."
Chihiro: "Oh, no... huh?"
Am I dreaming?
Or having a nightmare?
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Shouta: "I'm home."
Chihiro: "Shouta-kun."
What on earth is happening?
I can't move, frozen in place.
Shouta: "I ran into the Section Chief at the station..."
Chihiro: "Is that so..."
Shouta: "He said he wanted to meet you since we were here..."
Chihiro: "..."
There's no way this is a coincidence.
They were heading in the opposite direction when they left.
I can feel the sweat trickling down my back.
This is what they call a bolt from the blue.
What on earth did he come here for?
Chihiro: "Please, come in."
Yuusaku: "Well then, I'll just make myself at home for a bit."
Plop.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
As he passes by,
Something brushes against my butt.
His bag?
Or...
Shouta: "Phew..."
Shouta-kun is in the middle of taking off his shoes.
I can't ask him either way.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I'll try to keep my distance as much as possible.
My mind has gone blank.
I couldn't think of anything else.
Just go home quickly.
Please, let me be alone with Shouta-kun....
...
Yuusaku: "Wow, I've really enjoyed your hospitality."
Chihiro: "Thank you for your kind words."
Yuusaku: "It was quite a treat."
Chihiro: "..."
It's been an hour since he arrived.
But he's already on his third beer.
He's eaten all the celebratory food.
Shouta-kun, on the other hand, hasn't eaten much.
He's acting formal in front of the Section Chief.
Yuusaku: "Well then..."
Chihiro: "..."
Finally, it looks like he's about to get up.
Yuusaku: "Section Chief Akizuki."
Shouta: "Yes?"
Yuusaku: "You left your letter of appointment on my desk, didn't you?"
Shouta: "Ah..."
Shouta-kun stands up, looking surprised.
He's a little flustered by the sudden development.
Shouta: "I'm sorry."
Yuusaku: "No need to apologize so much."
Shouta: "Yes, sir."
Yuusaku: "Well, you must have been so happy that you forgot about it."
Shouta: "I'm truly grateful."
Chihiro: "..."
The Section Chief's brazen attitude hasn't changed.
But he's unusually gentle.
He's completely different from the first time he came here.
Is it because Shouta-kun is now a Section Chief?
Maybe that's the case.
Yuusaku: "Congratulations, truly."
Shouta: "Thank you very much."
Yuusaku: "Make sure you show the letter of appointment to your wife."
Chihiro: "No, I..."
Shouta: "Here..."
He spread the paper without waiting for my response.
This was the only time Shouta looked genuinely proud.
I thought it would be bad for him if I was too reluctant...
So I just glanced at the document, intending to make a mere show of it.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
It was incredible.
Shouta's name written in brush script.
Just a single piece of paper, yet I felt a resonating weight in my heart.
Chihiro: "..."
That's right.
For someone being employed, the title is important.
It also gives off an aura that makes you realize this once again.
This is not just a piece of paper for Shouta.
And, of course, not for me either.
Congratulations.
I want to tell him that from the bottom of my heart.
After all, his efforts have finally been rewarded.
Yuusaku: "Madam, from today he is a Section Chief."
Chihiro: "I... I look forward to working with you from now on."
Yuusaku: "The same goes for me."
As he nodded, Chief's gaze moved to Shouta.
Yuusaku: "But don't be content with this."
Shouta: "Y-Yes."
Yuusaku: "I want you to aim higher."
Shouta: "I-I'll do my best."
Yuusaku: "Did you hear his words, madam?"
Flip.
Chihiro: "!?"
Yuusaku: "Aren't they reassuring words?"
Chihiro: "Ah...ah..."
My skirt was flipped up.
With his foot.
Shouta: "...Chihiro."
Chihiro: "Huh...what...?"
Shouta: "I'm really going to try my best."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
A tense face.
I couldn't respond to Shouta's words.
While I was like that, the hem was gradually being lifted higher.
Stop it.
My underwear will be visible.
The incident with the molester suddenly flashed back in my mind.
It was the same as then.
I couldn't even let out a small scream.
What should I do?
What should I do, what should I do...
Should I grab Chief's foot?
Should I clearly say 'stop it'?
Chihiro: "..."
While maintaining my posture, I desperately stretched out only my arm.
Shouta is still looking at me.
So, it's impossible to move my body exaggeratedly.
Chihiro: "(Wait a minute...)"
Stay still.
His foot was moving around inside my skirt.
The moment I tried to grab it, he evaded.
Somehow, I felt like I was being mocked by the chief.
But I also couldn't caution him with words.
Yuusaku: "Aren't you going to respond to him?"
Chihiro: "...Huh?"
My mind was empty in the predicament I fell into.
Yuusaku: "Section Chief Akizuki says he's going to do his best."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yuusaku: "Or perhaps there's no need for him to work hard?"
Shouta: "Is... is that so?"
Chihiro: "No, that's not it."
It's awful.
I desperately deny it.
Chihiro: "Please, stop."
Shouta: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "So you're saying, it's bad if Akizuki-kun tries hard, right?"
Shouta: "Is... is that so?"
Chihiro: "No, that's not what I'm talking about..."
I am desperately denying it.
Chihiro: "It...it's not about Shouta."
Ugh...
Chihiro: "Ah...uh..."
No.
His toes slipped in between my knees.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Please stop.
Now he's trying to spread my legs.
With such indecency, my whole body gets goosebumps.
I put all the strength I have in my thighs.
I won't let them open even a millimeter more.
Ugh... ugh...
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Back and forth.
Being pried open a little, then closing.
Closing, then being opened slightly again.
Yuusaku: "...Akizuki-kun."
Shouta: "Y...yes."
Yuusaku: "There's no way your wife would say 'don't work hard', right?"
Shouta: "Of course."
His gaze, seeking agreement.
Don't, Shouta.
Don't involve me in the conversation.
The struggle is making my inner thighs sore.
If I let my guard down even a little, I won't be able to resist.
Yuusaku: "You were surprised, right?"
Shouta: "I... I was."
Ugh...ugh...ugh...
Please.
Give up already.
How long are you planning on doing this?
Ugh...
Chihiro: "Uh...ah..."
I can't anymore.
At this point, I have no choice but to scream.
I hate the self-loathing that will come later.
Yuusaku: "So, shall we surprise you even more?"
Shouta: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "I have a good picture, actually."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I swallow my scream.
Without realizing it, I'm even covering my mouth.
The cell phone taken out of his breast pocket.
Yuusaku is grinning.
He looks at the screen with a meaningful expression.
No...no way...
Shouta: "A picture...?"
Yuusaku: "I'll show you what kind of room I live in."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Shouta: "P...please, I'd love to see it."
Yuusaku: "...I wonder what I should do."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
My heart feels like it's going to stop.
In addition, I realize the foolishness of letting out a scream.
"I'm not trying to spread anyone's legs."
With just that one phrase, it'll be over.
All that will remain is an awkward atmosphere.
What should be a day of celebration will be ruined.
But Yuusaku is different.
I can’t deny it. The evidence is damning.
Photos of me taken in this very room.
How am I supposed to talk my way out of this lie?
Of course, I did it all for Shouta.
I need to explain carefully, or he’ll misunderstand.
But to do that, I’d have to tell him everything.
And if that happens, there’s no way I can think about promotion anymore.
Everything would fall apart.
Chihiro: "Ah... no..."
Please...
Don’t show him.
Don’t tell Shouta about my lies.
Yuusaku: "..."
Pulls hard.
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
I have no way to fight back now.
Effortlessly, he spreads my legs apart.
What kind of position is this?
It’s way too humiliating.
I feel like my face is about to burst into flames.
Shouta: "You’re not going to show me?"
Yuusaku: "What should we do, ma’am?"
Chihiro: "...What?"
The pressure on my legs suddenly eases.
Yuusaku: "Give me an answer."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
I can’t close my legs.
The Section Chief’s gaze was commanding—threatening even.
It’s such a vile method, it makes me sick.
But I can’t defy him right now.
I don’t want to ruin Shouta’s happiness.
Chihiro: "Maybe... next time..."
Shouta: "Huh?"
Shouta’s face was puzzled, as expected.
It’s no surprise.
Our conversation is so obviously unnatural.
The only one enjoying himself is the Section Chief.
He’s the absolute worst kind of person.
He’s relishing in my flustered reactions.
Yuusaku: "Alright then, maybe I’ll wait until I can get an even better photo."
Shouta: "Oh... um, okay..."
The phone slid back into his pocket.
But I couldn’t let out a sigh of relief.
I’m still in this shameful position.
It was better when he was holding my legs down.
Now it looks like I’m willingly sitting like this.
I look like an indecent woman.
If Shouta sees me like this, he’ll definitely think so.
Just imagining it made me shiver.
This is the first time I’ve ever felt like this.
Chihiro: "..."
...No. That’s not true.
It’s not the first time.
It’s the same as after I threw away my underwear in the train station restroom.
Walking through the streets completely exposed...
I felt like everyone was staring at me.
And for some reason, I feel like that now too.
The Section Chief is deliberately talking about work.
So no one’s actually looking at me.
But why can’t I stay calm?
It’s like someone is hiding under the table, watching me.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
It’s probably just my overwhelming embarrassment.
That’s making me imagine things that aren’t real.
If this keeps up, I feel like I’ll lose my mind.
Please, let me close my legs.
This is too humiliating.
I’m just wearing loungewear—I don’t even have stockings on.
I'm only concealing my intimate parts with a single piece of underwear.
I feel like an incredibly lewd woman.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
It's past 10 o'clock.
I've been keeping my legs spread for about 15 minutes now.
But I can't just close them on my own.
Occasionally, Mr. Kazama checks in.
He stretches out my legs to check how wide they are.
Disgusting.
I glare at Mr. Kazama.
Of course, he acts as if he doesn't notice.
He continues talking to my husband.
Yuusaku: "...That's what it's about."
Shouta: "Ah, yes."
Yuusaku: "I'm counting on you from now on."
Shouta: "I, I'll do my best."
Shouta, saying that, tries to pour beer.
But the bottle is empty.
Shouta: "...Chihiro."
Chihiro: "Yeah, yeah."
I knew, too.
So, don't look at me like that.
I can't move freely right now.
I send a pleading gaze towards Mr. Kazama.
I'm subconsciously seeking his permission.
What am I doing?
It's just a bottle of beer.
This is Shouta and my home...
Yuusaku: "I'm going to call it a day."
Shouta: "Is, is that so?"
Mr. Kazama, stretching leisurely...
He rattles the chair as he stands up...
...
Yuusaku: "Thanks for having me, Mrs."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Right after being released from the embarrassing position...
I can't utter a word.
But if I don't act properly, Shouta will be embarrassed.
Chihiro: "I, I wasn't able to serve you properly..."
Saying only that took all my strength.
As if to make up for my halting words, I deeply bow my head.
I feel so regretful that I feel like crying.
So, I can't lift my head from its bowed position.
Yuusaku: "Well, see you tomorrow."
Shouta: "Yes, yes."
Chihiro: "..."
The sound of the door closing.
Shouta yawns and heads to the living room.
Of course, I can't just stand still.
Chihiro: "Sho, Shouta."
Shouta: "Hm?"
Chihiro: "I, I'm going to the convenience store for a bit."
Without waiting for a reply, I head outside.
I hurriedly follow after Mr. Kazama.
I don't want to spend a sleepless night.
I want to confront him about what he intends.
The elevator has just arrived on the first floor.
I can still make it.
Forgetting that I'm only wearing sandals...
I run down the stairs so fast that everyone would turn around.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I feel a bit of self-loathing.
I've lied to Shouta again.
It's a vicious cycle.
I'm clearly straying onto a path I don't want.
Chihiro: "Haa...haa..."
There's no sign of Mr. Kazama.
But I can't give up.
**: "You've got a nice body."
Chihiro: "...!?"
It was when I was about to start running towards the station.
I sensed someone behind me.
I was suddenly held from behind.
Chihiro: "Nn...nn...ahh!!"
A thick arm wrapped around my neck.
I can't scream because my throat is blocked.
My personal alarm is still in my bag.
All I can do is kick my legs.
A pervert?
Or a street robber?
Chihiro: "Nn...guh...uh..."
I was dragged along to the side of the apartment building.
I was dragged along without caring that my sandals were coming off.
Someone, help me.
I might get killed.
Yuusaku: "...Don't struggle so much."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I was taken to an empty bicycle parking area.
There, I was finally released.
Yuusaku: "Were you surprised?"
Chihiro: "Hic..."
Of course.
I can't stop shaking.
For the first time in my life, I was conscious of death.
Yuusaku: "I thought you might follow me."
Chihiro: "If... if that's the case... you should've... waited normally..."
My throat is dry.
The words were caught and wouldn't come out.
There are many things I want to say.
So many that it muddles my mind.
I take a deep breath.
I need to calm down quickly.
While I'm doing that, Mr. Kazama is smiling leisurely.
It's infuriating.
But I'll hold back from lashing out until I've questioned him.
Instead, I'll make my feelings clear by glaring at him.
Yuusaku: "You're looking scary."
Chihiro: "After what you did, it would be strange to be smiling."
Yuusaku: "Hmm..."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Perhaps because I've calmed down a bit...
The fear from earlier suddenly comes rushing back.
Tears are falling from my eyes.
Even if I try to hold back, I can't stop.
Yuusaku: "Don't cry."
Chihiro: "Isn't it your fault?"
Yuusaku: "Hmph..."
Mr. Kazama closes the distance.
I step back.
Only one of my sandals is on.
The pebbles biting into my bare foot hurt.
Chihiro: "Why... why did you lie...?"
Yuusaku: "Lie?"
Chihiro: "You... you said you'd give up."
Yuusaku: "That was just to share information."
Chihiro: "...eh?"
Yuusaku: "In other words, unlike someone, I wasn't lying."
Chihiro: "I... I don't understand what you're saying."
Yuusaku: "It's enough if I understand it."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
He's getting closer again.
This is not the time to cry.
The danger is still present.
Chihiro: "...I'll scream."
Yuusaku: "You can't."
Chihiro: "I... I can."
Yuusaku: "You held back when your legs were spread."
Chihiro: "...That was because my husband was beside me..."
Yuusaku: "Is that all?"
He conspicuously showed his cell phone.
Yuusaku: "The main reason is this, right?"
Chihiro: "I... I won't hold back anymore."
Yuusaku: "Hmm..."
Chihiro: "If I explain properly, they'll understand."
Yuusaku: "Who will?"
Chihiro: "Of course... my husband."
Yuusaku: "What you're trying to protect is just a pathetic marital relationship."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "In that case, I'll send a mail to your husband. Of course, with lots of lovely comments."
Chihiro: "That's... cruel..."
Yuusaku: "You should do your best to explain. To convince him, you have to spill everything that's happened so far."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "And, what will you do after you win him over?"
Chihiro: "Of course... we'll discuss it together."
Yuusaku: "Discuss what?"
Chihiro: "About... our future..."
Yuusaku: "Whose?"
Chihiro: "Ours... between you and us."
Yuusaku: "Well, that's a problem."
Mr. Kazama is still grinning as usual.
He doesn't look troubled at all.
Yuusaku: "Then I have to come up with a countermeasure."
Chihiro: "Are you going... to do something weird again?"
Yuusaku: "Maybe I should send a letter to your husband's parents."
Chihiro: "!?"
Yuusaku: "'Your son's wife keeps coming to my room, as her boss, and begs for sex. It's quite bothersome'... something like that."
Chihiro: "Please... stop lying."
Yuusaku: "If they see the pictures as evidence, I wonder who they'll believe."
Chihiro: "Stop... please stop..."
I can't go on.
I've collapsed, weakly.
I feel like a deflated doll.
I've lost all my strength.
Chihiro: "Why... why are you always so cruel to me?"
Yuusaku: "...I don't like it."
Chihiro: "I don't remember doing anything to make you think so."
Yuusaku: "You seem to be a very virtuous wife."
Chihiro: "It's not like I'm..."
Yuusaku: "Then, who do you have sex with?"
Chihiro: "It's... it's obviously only with my husband."
Yuusaku: "I wonder if the ring on your ring finger is such a heavy thing."
Again, Mr. Kazama takes a step forward.
This is bad.
I can't move.
He's definitely going to do something to me.
This time, he's definitely going to touch my chest or something.
Yuusaku: "See you tomorrow."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
He definitely touched me.
He patted my head as if I was a good girl.
Yuusaku: "Goodnight, everyone's wife."
Chihiro: "..."
Suddenly, I was left alone.
The tense atmosphere was cut off unilaterally.
I feel a great sense of exhaustion.
Because of that, I can't stand up yet.
See you tomorrow?
Everyone's wife?
What does it mean?
My heart is full of anxiety.
It's so dark I can't see a step ahead.
Chihiro: "Ha..."
I force a deep breath.
I refill the air in my flimsy body.
I have to get back to my room quickly.
Shouta will be worried.
I pick up my fallen sandals.
I dust them off and put them on my bare feet.
Now I can finally walk normally.
But it's somehow sad.
Each and every thing I'm doing.
It's starting to feel terribly miserable...
...
...Click...thud...
Chihiro: "...Shouta?"
Shouta: "Welcome back."
Chihiro: "...I'm back."
Shouta: "Huh, didn't you go to the convenience store?"
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I messed up.
I came back empty-handed.
I'm so upset that I even forgot to pretend.
Chihiro: "...I changed my mind on the way."
Shouta: "I see."
Chihiro: "..."
Another lie.
Shouta: "Sorry, it was supposed to be a celebration."
Chihiro: "...Why are you apologizing, Shouta?"
Shouta: "Because I brought Mr. Kazama without notifying you."
Chihiro: "It's not like that..."
I'm at a loss for words.
I feel like crying.
Chihiro: "Sho, Shouta."
Shouta: "...?"
I hug him.
If I don't, I can't pretend to be calm.
I'll probably start sobbing.
Shouta: "...What's the matter all of a sudden?"
Chihiro: "..."
I can't say it.
The reason.
Chihiro: "Co, congratulations on your promotion."
Shouta: "...Thanks."
Chihiro: "..."
His scent, which I love so much.
I'm a chick in a nest.
As long as I'm doing this, my tears will retreat.
Shouta: "It must be thanks to you, Chihiro."
Chihiro: "...?"
Shouta: "Even my promotion is thanks to you, Chihiro."
Chihiro: "I didn't do anything."
Shouta: "You're supporting me in every way, aren't you?"
Chihiro: "..."
That's not it.
I nearly held you back, Shouta.
Just like earlier.
I don't know what to do anymore.
Shouta: "Can I ask you now?"
Chihiro: "...Huh?"
Shouta: "About what you were talking about on the phone."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I inadvertently pulled away from him.
My face tensed up.
I'm in trouble.
Handling his reaction...
I don't have any capacity left for it.
Probably because too much has happened.
Shouta: "I'm quite nervous, you know."
Chihiro: "Ye, yeah, well..."
Shouta: "Did you have some kind of trouble?"
Chihiro: "Well..."
Shouta: "Or is there something you want?"
Chihiro: "...I was thinking of quitting the cooking class."
Shouta: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "..."
It's not a whim.
It's something I've been thinking about for a while.
I can study just by reading a book.
With the extra money, I can spend more on Shouta.
He's become a section chief.
New shoes, bags, suits.
He'll need various things from now on.
Now is the perfect time.
Being pregnant is a good opportunity.
Shouta: "Immediately?"
Chihiro: "I'm planning to finish it by the end of this month."
Shouta: "Is it not very enjoyable?"
Chihiro: "No, that's why I'll go properly tomorrow."
Shouta: "If that's the case, you should continue."
Chihiro: "I've learned all the basics in a year."
Shouta: "...I see."
Chihiro: "I'm sorry for being selfish."
Shouta: "Not at all."
Chihiro: "..."
I hugged him again.
Because I was confused by my own words.
It's strange.
It's like I have two brains and I can't make them agree.
Of course...
I want him to continue being the section chief.
But for some reason, I feel a fear of what that means.
I feel like I'm going crazy.
Someone, help me.
I'm really going to go insane.

Chihiro: "Yo, you can do what you want."
Yuusaku: "If you think it's just talk, you're greatly mistaken."
Mr. Kazama immediately starts pushing the button.
But I won't stop him.
Yuusaku: "The wife who came to play in my room in secret, and..."
Chihiro: "..."
Turning my back on him, I started walking.
It was stupid of me to be so conscientious.
Section Chief Kazama is a base person who wishes for others' misfortunes.
He's not the type of person you can reason with.
I don't want to just go along with what he says anymore.
That would only result in me being taken advantage of.
It's just a chain of misfortunes, like lies.
That's why it has to be cut off somewhere.
Chihiro: "..."
I should have reached a conclusion sooner.
The regret is proportional to how long I've been patient.
I ignore the sandals that are lying on the side of the road.
I want to return to my room as quickly as possible.
And I'll tell Shouta everything.
If I don't, without a doubt, I will...
I will pay a large price, so large that I can't believe it myself.
