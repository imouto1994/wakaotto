...The following day, 4 pm...
Chihiro: "Phew..."
It was another terribly hot day.
Just going shopping left me drenched in sweat.
I've finally made it to my apartment and am taking a breather.
I have a heavy bag in each hand.
At this rate, my arms might bulk up.
But I can't afford to worry about that.
All for my beloved Shou-chan.
I have to cook him lots of delicious food.
Ding... swoosh...
Chihiro: "...?"
I stepped off the elevator and halted.
My home is about 10 meters ahead.
There's something unfamiliar hanging on the doorknob.
What on earth could it be?
I approach the door, tilting my head.
With each step, a bad premonition grows stronger.
And soon, it becomes a reality.
Chihiro: "..."
I stand there, speechless.
What was hanging on the knob was a woman's underwear.
And not just any underwear, but a familiar pair of pure white panties.
Could it be the ones I threw away in the toilet at the station?
Chihiro: "..."
What ridiculous thoughts am I having?
Thinking calmly, that's not possible.
There's no name or anything written on it.
I dropped the plastic bags I was carrying on the ground.
I quickly rolled the underwear into my hand, then timidly looked around.
Luckily, there was no one in sight.
But someone who passed by might have seen it.
The thought alone is enough to depress me.
To make matters worse, in my hurry, I'm struggling to insert the key.
Unusually for me, I'm irritated.
Damn it!
Just open already.
Chihiro: "Huff..."
Oh no.
I've left the supermarket bags outside.
Without even taking off my shoes, I open the door again.
I reach through the gap, grab the intended item and drag it inside.
I hate the fact that I'm sneaking around.
But the guilty feeling naturally makes me act this way.
Of course, this underwear is the cause.
Even though I haven't done anything wrong.
Chihiro: "..."
I looked at the panties again.
I definitely recognize them.
The lace pattern that I really liked.
Could it be that my laundry was blown away by the wind?
...
That's not possible.
No one other than me could identify it as mine.
Chihiro: "...?"
There's something rough in the middle.
The image of the underwear I threw away in the trash overlaps again.
But on closer inspection, it seems a bit yellowed?
Chihiro: "Ah..."
With a stiff face, I threw the panties away.
Chihiro: "..."
Then I went straight to the washroom and washed my hands vigorously.
It's not like I checked the smell or anything.
But I have a hunch what that is.
Semen.
It definitely is.
The faucet is still running.
I've scrubbed so much that my hands are starting to sting.
But I still can't stop washing.
Because I touched it directly with my fingers.
Why wasn't I more careful?
I'm such a fool.
Chihiro: "..."
I don't want to touch it, let alone look at it.
But I couldn't leave it as it was.
So reluctantly, I go over to the rolled-up thin fabric.
In my hand is a large amount of tissue.
I carefully wrap the picked-up underwear in it, making sure not to touch it directly.
Then, I head straight to the trash can.
I hid it at the very bottom so it can't be seen from the outside.
Finally, I take a breather.
But I can't relax.
Now all sorts of thoughts are racing through my mind.
Who would play such a prank?
No, this is beyond a prank.
It's a malicious harassment.
Ring-ring-ring... ring-ring-ring...
Chihiro: "!?"
I thought my heart would stop.
For some reason, my feet get tangled.
With my sweaty hand, I pick up the receiver.
Chihiro: "H-hello?"
Yusaku: "It's Sazama."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
The timing is the worst.
Of all times, it had to be now.
He's bound to say something odd again.
Chihiro: "My husband is always in your care."
I give an excessively polite response.
I was planning to exhaust myself to end the call quickly.
Chihiro: "Um, is there something you need?"
Yusaku: "Actually, it's about Akizuki-kun..."
Chihiro: "About my husband?"
Yusaku: "I'm thinking of recommending him as a department head."
Chihiro: "..."
I freeze for a moment.
I'm not sure how to respond.
Chihiro: "Th-thank you."
That's the first thing that came out.
But why would he call me about personnel matters?
I wonder why.
Yusaku: "So, please pass this on to Akizuki-kun from your side."
Chihiro: "Eh?"
Yusaku: "I haven't told him anything yet."
Chihiro: "W-wait a minute, please."
Yusaku: "What is it?"
Chihiro: "W-what do you mean?"
Yusaku: "I don't understand what you mean."
Chihiro: "Why wouldn't you tell him directly, Section Chief...?"
Yusaku: "I'm sure Akizuki-kun will be happier if he hears it from his wife."
Chihiro: "I, I don't think that's the issue here. I'm just married to my husband, I'm not directly involved in his work..."
Yusaku: "By the way, have you thought about the dinner proposal?"
Chihiro: "..."
Section Chief Sazama suddenly changes the subject.
I feel a strong sense of disgust at his obviousness.
Yusaku: "I'll invite only you to my home."
Chihiro: "..."
I'm fed up.
I wish he would stop this, including the harassment.
Even if he is my husband's boss, there are things that are acceptable and things that are not.
Chihiro: "What do you mean by that?"
Yusaku: "Didn't I say it was a thank you for the feast?"
Chihiro: "Either way, I decline. I didn't do much hospitality, and it's strange to invite just me."
Yusaku: "Hmm..."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
What comes to my mind is the Section Chief's grinning face.
Probably the same face he had when he molested me.
Yusaku: "You like white, don't you, madam?"
Chihiro: "Huh?"
The topic has been changed again.
I intend to be vague about the inconvenient answers.
But I won't let that happen.
This has to be stated clearly.
Chihiro: "Anyway, I decline your invitation."
Yusaku: "I happened to be passing by, but it's a pity that you weren't home."
Chihiro: "Eh?"
I inadvertently ask again.
Chihiro: "...Um, what are you talking about?"
Yusaku: "I had no choice but to hang it on the knob. I wanted to hand it over directly, but I can't afford to wait."
Chihiro: "..."
The knob.
He hung it?
Chihiro: "C-could it be... that was... you, Section Chief...?"
Yusaku: "So, you always wear white, don't you?"
Chihiro: "..."
Things that were scattered in my mind.
They are all beautifully connected in a single line.
That time.
When he said he was sobering up and went into the bathroom alone.
This man could steal my underwear.
But I can't confront him directly.
If I'm wrong, it could be a big problem.
Chihiro: "Why... why do you have my underwear?"
Yusaku: "I wonder..."
Chihiro: "..."
I wonder?
What's that supposed to mean?
Yusaku: "It probably slipped in by accident. I was doing various things in the bathroom and taking off my pants while I was drunk."
Chihiro: "Even if you say it slipped in..."
What a lie-like answer.
As if underwear would just jump out of the washing machine on its own.
But I can't say it.
I can't call my husband's boss an underwear thief.
Yusaku: "About the matter earlier, when shall we do it?"
Chihiro: "Eh?"
Yusaku: "The talk about coming to my place for a meal."
Chihiro: "Please, enough already."
Clack.
Chihiro: "..."
I hung up on him again.
But I should not be at fault.
It's the Section Chief who's wrong for saying unreasonable and naughty things.
What's with liking white?
That's a matter for me and Sho alone.
I glanced at the phone.
A premonition that it might ring again.
Things I used to use every day seem like tools of fear now.
Chihiro: "..."
...
I boldly pull out the phone line from its root.
If there's an emergency, Sho can call my cell phone.
So it's okay.
Chihiro: "Haah..."
A strong sense of exhaustion.
I plopped down on the floor in a girl's sit.
What on earth is going on?
More and more things are troubling my mind.
First, the molestation.
Then the persistent invitations.
Finally, underwear theft.
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Oh no...
I shouldn't have thought about it.
That rough feeling.
Was that Section Chief's semen?
Did he use my underwear to do something lewd?
Chihiro: "Uh...Ugh..."
Feeling like the finishing blow has been dealt.
I hurriedly run to the toilet.
I huddle, clutching the toilet seat.
Just let it out...
Chihiro: "Uh...Ugh..."
My stomach contracts.
But I can't vomit.
It's just painful.
It's a terrible mental damage.
The most cursed thing is that I touched it directly.
I can't get the Section Chief's face out of my head.
That rough feeling.
It's too disgusting.
Chihiro: "Ugh...Ugh..."
I feel like hating myself.
I also feel sorry for Sho.
I feel like I've indirectly betrayed him.
I'm sorry.
Really sorry...
...
...
...
...The same day, 9 PM...
Ding-dong.
Chihiro: "Yes?"
Chihiro: "Welcome home."
Shota: "I'm home."
Chihiro: "You're a bit early today."
Shota: "Yeah, the Section Chief told me to go home early once in a while."
Chihiro: "I, I see."
Shota: "I'm hungry."
Chihiro: "Then, let's have dinner first today."
Shota: "Okay."
Chihiro: "..."
Shota, with a smile, heads to the living room.
Just as lively as yesterday.
Even if it's been a terrible day for me.
I'm always happy when he's in high spirits.
Thank you for your hard work every day.
While thanking him in my heart, I line up Shota's shoes.
Speaking of which, it's been about two years since we bought these shoes.
Even though I've been taking good care of them, they've started to look old.
The heels are worn out as well...
Chihiro: "...Hey."
Shota: "Hmm?"
Chihiro: "Let's buy new shoes."
Shota: "These are still wearable."
Chihiro: "...I bet you'd say that even if the heel was completely gone."
Shota: "Hahaha."
While loosening his tie, he smiles again.
He gently pats my head.
Shota: "I'll just take the sentiment for now."
Chihiro: "I think we can afford to buy shoes though..."
Shota: "What about our dream home then?"
Chihiro: "..."
To build our own house within ten years.
That's what Shota declared when we got married.
Chihiro: "Can't we do it within fifteen years?"
Shota: "No way."
Chihiro: "Why?"
Shota: "Just because."
Chihiro: "..."
I know the reason.
He told me when we were dating.
His parents live in a small municipal apartment.
It seems to have been his complex since he was little.
He was extremely embarrassed when he introduced me to his parents.
Even though I don't mind at all.
Shota: "I got praised by the section chief again today."
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Shota: "If I keep this up and don't mess up, my salary might increase too. Maybe I should aim to do it within eight years."
Chihiro: "Um, Shota..."
Shota: "...?"
Chihiro: "..."
What should I do?
What should I do, what should I do.
Good news and bad news.
Which one should I tell Shota?
To be honest, I'm so confused I feel dizzy.
Tell him about the new position?
Tell him about Mr. Zama, the section chief?
Chihiro: "Actually... I got a call from the section chief..."
Shota: "From Zama, the section chief?"
Chihiro: "Y-Yes."
Shota: "...What could it be?"
Chihiro: "..."
Shota's face stiffened a bit.
He's still not comfortable with it.
He's the person who's been scolding him all this time.
It's not something that can change so easily.
That's why the happiness of being praised is a hundred times greater.
I understand his feelings so well that it hurts.
Chihiro: "...He said he wants to recommend you for the chief position."
Shota: "Who?"
Chihiro: "You, Shota."
Shota: "Who did?"
Chihiro: "Like I said, Mr. Zama, the section chief."
Shota: "..."
Chihiro: "I don't know why he told me, but..."
Shota: "Yes!!"
Chihiro: "!?"
Shota suddenly hugged me.
Then he showered my cheek with kisses.
Chihiro: "W-Wait..."
Shota: "..."
Chihiro: "...?"
Shota: "... ..."
Chihiro: "..."
Is he crying?
Is Shota crying in front of me?
Shota: "...I'm so happy."
Chihiro: "Y-Yeah."
Naturally, my arms moved to his back.
I held him tightly in an embrace.
Chihiro: "...That's great."
Shota: "Sniff..."
Chihiro: "..."
It really was for the best.
Not bringing up Section Chief Zama was the right choice.
That was probably just a temporary thing.
It's something we can deal with by simply ignoring it.
What matters most is Shota's happiness.
His joy is something irreplaceable, and it also makes me happy.
So, this is fine.
It’s better not to make things more complicated...
...
*Squelch*...
Shota: "Mmh... ha... nn... nn..."
Chihiro: "Mm... ah..."
Shota: "Chi-Chihiro..."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Maybe it’s because his emotions are heightened right now.
Shota was a bit more assertive than usual today.
But of course, knowing his gentle nature...
He wasn’t rough in the slightest.
Even so, I could sense a faint, masculine boldness.
And that excited me too.
I had a feeling I was about to reach my limit for the first time in a while.
A warmth and tingling spread through my lower abdomen...
And my whole body felt light and floaty.
Shota: "Ah... ah..."
Chihiro: "Sh-Shota..."
I’m close.
I’m going to come soon.
*Squirt*...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Shota: "Ahh... ahhh—!"
Chihiro: "..."
Shota: "S-sorry... Chihiro, did you... come?"
Chihiro: "Y-Yeah... a few times."
Shota: "Ah, I’m glad."
Chihiro: "I felt really good too."
Shota: "Hah..."
His sweat-covered body slumped against me.
I felt a bit unsatisfied, but still, I was happy.
Shota looked so blissful...
So I felt like I should be content too.
Chihiro: "Hey..."
Shota: "..."
Chihiro: "Shota?"
Shota: "Zzz... zzz..."
Chihiro: "...?"
He fell asleep.
He must be really tired.
And yet, he's still loving me. Thank you.
Kind Shota.
I love you.
Now and forever.
Always stay by my side...
...
...
...
Chihiro: "Actually, there's something I want to discuss with you..."
Shota: "...What's up?"
Chihiro: "..."
Shota seems worried by the gravity in my voice.
But I have to tell him today.
If I let it go like this, it's probably going to get serious.
I stared hard into Shota's eyes.
This is not just a trivial matter for him.
So I need to explain it logically and clearly.
So that it can be settled in one go.
Chihiro: "I was thinking about discussing it yesterday as well..."
Shota: "Y-Yeah."
The fact that I saw his penis in the changing room.
Looking back now, that was deliberate.
And the fact that I was molested on my way back from the cooking class.
The call that came in and the invitation to have dinner.
The fact that soiled underwear was hanging from the doorknob.
I started talking about each and every one of them, deliberately suppressing my emotions.
At first, Shota was nodding along as he listened.
But halfway through, he even forgot to respond.
He just sat there, blood draining from his face.
Shota: "...Mr. Zama, the section chief?"
Chihiro: "..."
I just nodded.
That was all I could manage.
Was it because I had relaxed after discussing it?
Tears started to pour out like a cork had been removed.
I couldn't bear it and threw myself into his chest.
Shota, although confused, hugged me.
That alone was enough.
All my fears and anxieties disappeared.
I'm glad I discussed it.
I'm glad the one holding me is him.
That's why I have a little regret.
The attitude I took when I was molested.
The fact that I only put up a vague resistance is frustrating.
I swear strongly in my heart.
This body is only for Shota.
I won't let anyone else touch it ever again...
