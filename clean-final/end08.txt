...Two months have passed since then...
Shota: "Chief."
Yusaku: "..."
Shota: "Uh, Chief?"
Yusaku: "Hm?"
Shota: "Sorry to bother you when you're busy."
Yusaku: "Has the handover been completed perfectly?"
Shota: "Yes, it has."
Yusaku: "If there's anything left in the desk, I'll dispose of it myself."
Shota: "No, it's okay. I checked earlier. I have a bullet train to catch, so I should get going..."
Yusaku: "Well, take care."
Shota: "Thank you for everything."
Yusaku: "..."
His slumped shoulders as he walks away.
There's a faint sense of melancholy.
He's changed quite a bit in the past month.
Probably half of it is my fault.
Well, can't be helped.
He's depressed enough to quit his job at the office.
Yusaku: "Hmph..."
It happened on the day of the summer festival.
Naturally, I went to see how things were going.
It was surprising.
Even though there were few customers, he didn't call out to anyone.
He just stood there with a pale face.
But the one who lost color was the same here.
"Chihiro has returned to the countryside."
With this one phrase, two scarecrows were completed.
The fool who lost Chihiro was like a bird that had its feathers plucked.
All he does at the office is sigh.
He can't really do his job.
Still, he seemed to think it was only temporary at first.
He didn't confess about our relationship.
He believed that Chihiro's emotional instability due to her pregnancy was the reason she returned home.
But no matter how many times he called, her parents wouldn't put Chihiro on the phone.
As the days went by, the situation became more and more suspicious.
And then, the nail in the coffin was the divorce papers that came in the mail.
Of course, he assumed it was her parents' doing.
He let his usually calm demeanor change, and ended up storming into Chihiro's parents' house.
From there, it was just a parade of unexcused absences.
When he does show up, all he does is sit in his chair.
His mental health is deteriorating.
About a month before he quit, he became a shut-in.
Yusaku: "..."
Me?
I'm back to my boring daily life.
I just work, return to my room, and spend my time watching adult videos and masturbating.
What else am I supposed to do?
Find a new woman?
Damn it.
If that's what you want, then someone convince me.
Explain the horrible event to me in a way I can understand.
Was it a sudden occurrence?
Or did I just handle the fermentation process badly?
At this point, it's all a fog.
But there's one thing that's clear.
Chihiro is no longer at her parents' home.
No matter how much I search, I can't find out where she is.
Yet, I can't bring myself to give up.
I didn't have the heart to delete her number from my phone.
What happened?
Is it because she ran away before I could fully understand her that I still feel so attached?
Yusaku: "..."
No...
It's not just that.
The grains of sand that slipped through my fingers...
There was something irreplaceable in that.
I understand that.
I know that...
Damn it.
If only someone could turn back time.
It wouldn't hurt for a miracle to happen just once.
I won't make the same mistake again.
That's a promise.
So, I beg you.
I'm even willing to make a deal with the devil.
So, please grant my wish...
