Kofukuoka City Hall
Zama Yuusaku: "Hey, Akizuki!!"
...
Akizuki Shouta: "Y-Yes, Chief Zama?"
Yuusaku: "You're so slow, you slowpoke."
Shouta: "I-I'm sorry."
Yuusaku: "On top of being slow, you can't even do your job properly. Who the hell told you to organize the documents by gender?"
Shouta: "E-Eh... I believe... it was you, Chief…"
Yuusaku: "…Huh?"
Shouta: "Ugh…"
Yuusaku: "…If you have an opinion, let’s hear it."
Shouta: "N-No, sir… I don't have anything to say…"
Yuusaku: "Damn, in a bureaucracy, seniority is fundamental. Not by gender, not by ability, but by age, age."
Shouta: "…I-I'll redo it right away."
Yuusaku: "Get your act together… Assistant Chief."
Shouta: "Y-Yes, sir."
Yuusaku: "Is your brain all pink from being newly married?"
Shouta: "…S-Such a thing…"
Yuusaku: "Then redo it by the end of today. If it's not done by the end of the day, you'll have to work through the night to finish it… Got it?"
Shouta: "U-Understood."
...

...
*Ding-dong*...
Akizuki Chihiro: "Coming!"
Shouta: "I'm home."
Chihiro: "Welcome home, Shouta. You're late again today."
Shouta: "Haa…"
Chihiro: "Are you very tired?"
Shouta: "…Mentally."
Chihiro: "Is it because of that chief again?"
Shouta: "Well… yeah..."
Chihiro: "I’ll listen to your complaints later. Go take a bath first, come on."
...
*Scrub*... *scrub*...
*Scrub*... *scrub*... *scrub*...
Shouta: "…"
Chihiro: "Have you lost weight again, I wonder?"
Shouta: "Maybe."
Chihiro: "You’ve been leaving a lot of your lunch uneaten lately. I just thought you were worn out from the summer heat, but…"
Shouta: "Ever since I became Assistant Chief, my appetite has plummeted."
Chihiro: "…Zama, the Chief, right?"
Shouta: "Yeah."
Chihiro: "I remember his father is the Director of Personnel."
Shouta: "He got in through his father's connections, so naturally…"
Chihiro: "He's very arrogant?"
Shouta: "It's not so much that he's arrogant, more like he just does whatever he wants."
Chihiro: "…Must be hard on you."
Shouta: "Because of him, I was late today. I did exactly as I was told, but he blamed his mistake on me…"
Chihiro: "..."
Poor Shouta...
Hang in there...
I'm here for you!
Chihiro: "Hey…"
Shouta: "Hmm?"
Hang in there
If it's too much, it's okay to quit
Chihiro: "Hang in there."
Shouta: "...I know."
Chihiro: "You can overcome it, Shouta. You might even get along with Chief Kazama eventually."
Chihiro: "If it's too much, it's okay to quit."
Shouta: "...R-Really?"
Chihiro: "No matter what happens, I'll be with you. I'm a housewife now, but I can always go back to work."
Shouta: "..."
Chihiro: "If you lose one more kilogram, let's quit."
Shouta: "...I'll be fine because I'll work hard."
Chihiro: "You don't have to push yourself, really."
Shouta: "If I quit easily, it will be bad for the teacher who recommended me, right?"
Chihiro: "I'll apologize with you."
Shouta: "Your parents, Chihiro, they... because I'm a stable civil servant..."
Chihiro: "Once we're married, it's all on our side."
Shouta: "Anyway, I'll continue working at the city hall. If I get depressed over something like this, I won't be useful no matter where I work."
Chihiro: "I thought you'd say that."
Shouta: "...Eh?"
Chihiro: "I think you can overcome it, Shouta. You might even get along with Chief Kazama eventually."
Shouta: "...Maybe that's a good opportunity."
Chihiro: "What is?"
Shouta: "It's sudden, but... He said he wants to come over tomorrow night."
Chihiro: "Chief Kazama?"
Shouta: "He said he wants to see with his own eyes if my brain has turned pink."
Chihiro: "What's a pink brain?"
Shouta: "Whether I've become stupid because of newlywed happiness."
Chihiro: "...Wow, that's intense."
Shouta: "I think I can refuse, but..."
Chihiro: "I'm welcoming him."
Shouta: "I, I can bring him?"
Chihiro: "I'll show off my cooking skills to make you look good, Shouta. I'll work hard too."
Shouta: "..."
Chihiro: "Oh, we're having the meal here, right?"
Shouta: "I think so... More than that, thank you, Chihiro..."
Chihiro: "...?"
Shouta: "For always helping me."
Chihiro: "It's a wife's duty."
...
Kiss...
Chihiro: "Mm..."
Kiss, smooch... smooch...
Chihiro: "Mm..."
Shouta: "U, u..."
Chihiro: "You came... right?"
Shouta: "U, yeah."
Chihiro: "..."
As always.
The penis was pulled out just before ejaculation.
Shouta splashed his semen on my belly button.
I lovingly play with it with my fingers.
The amount is still just a little as always.
If you ejaculate more, it would feel even better.
So, I've tried various things with food and stuff.
But it doesn't change much.
He's not a very sexually active person to begin with...
Shouta: "...Sorry for being quick."
Chihiro: "Not at all."
I desperately shake my head.
Chihiro: "It was really good."
Shouta: "I, I also felt good."
Chihiro: "...Shall we go to sleep soon?"
Shouta: "Yeah..."
We turn off the lights and crawl into the futon.
As always, I'm held by Shouta.
His chest is skinny, but reliable for me.
I'm really happy.
I fall asleep easily when we're like this...
...

Yuusaku: "..."
Yuusaku: "Damn, he's an idiot."
Don't move to the point of connection when you cum inside.
Isn't the whole screen full of mosaic?
Focus on the actress's face twisted in agony.
What's the point if the guy filming gets excited?
Stupid bastard.
Die.
If you don't want to die, let me hold the camera.
You're so bad it makes my dick wilt.
Yuusaku: "Hmph..."
I let go of my semi-erect penis and gulped down my half-drunk beer.
It's slippery and tastes bad.
Damn it.
The snack is sea chicken.
It's the one I opened yesterday.
I eat it even in summer.
A stomach as strong as my dick.
That's why I haven't eaten anything decent tonight.
Well, it doesn't matter.
Tomorrow I'll have dinner at the stupid Akizuki's house.
I might get a decent meal for the first time in a while.
I don't know what kind of woman he married.
But judging from his bento, his cooking skills are OK.
So I'll put up with it even if she's ugly.
After all, he's useless.
I'm sure she's an ugly girl whose only advantage is being young.
