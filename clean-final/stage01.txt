Koufukugaoka City Hall
Zama Yuusaku: "Hey, Akizuki!!"
...
Akizuki Shouta: "Y-Yes, Chief Zama?"
Yuusaku: "You're too fucking slow, you idiot."
Shouta: "I-I'm sorry."
Yuusaku: "On top of being slow, you can't even do your job properly. Who the hell told you to organize the documents by gender?"
Shouta: "E-Eh... I believe... it was you, Chief…"
Yuusaku: "…Huh?"
Shouta: "Ugh…"
Yuusaku: "…If you've got something to say, go ahead. I might just hear you out."
Shouta: "N-No, sir… I don't have anything to say…"
Yuusaku: "Good grief. In the government sector, seniority is king, isn't it? We don't rank people by gender, and we certainly don't rank them by talent. We go by age! Just age!"
Shouta: "…I-I'll redo it right away."
Yuusaku: "Get your act together… Assistant Chief."
Shouta: "Y-Yes, sir."
Yuusaku: "Are you so fresh from your honeymoon that your brain is nothing but pink mush?"
Shouta: "…S-Such a thing…"
Yuusaku: "Then redo it today. If it's not done today, you'll have to work through the night to finish it… Got it?"
Shouta: "U-Understood."
...

...
*Ding-dong*...
Akizuki Chihiro: "Coming!"
Shouta: "I'm home."
Chihiro: "Welcome home, Shou-chan. You're late again today."
Shouta: "Haa…"
Chihiro: "Are you very tired?"
Shouta: "…Mentally."
Chihiro: "Is it because of that chief again?"
Shouta: "Well… yeah..."
Chihiro: "I'll listen to your complaints. But first, let's take a bath. Come on."
...
*Scrub*... *scrub*...
*Scrub*... *scrub*... *scrub*...
Shouta: "…"
Chihiro: "Have you lost a little weight again, I wonder?"
Shouta: "Maybe."
Chihiro: "You've been leaving leftovers in your bento a lot lately. I simply thought maybe the summer heat was getting to you…"
Shouta: "Ever since I became Assistant Chief, my appetite has totally tanked."
Chihiro: "…It's because of Chief Zama, right?"
Shouta: "Yeah."
Chihiro: "If I recall, his father is the Director of Human Resources, right?"
Shouta: "He got in through his father's connections, so naturally…"
Chihiro: "He's very bossy?"
Shouta: "More than just bossy, it feels like he just does whatever he pleases."
Chihiro: "…It must be hard for you."
Shouta: "He's the reason why I was late again today. I did exactly as I was told, but he still blamed his own mistake on me…"
Chihiro: "..."
Poor Shou-chan...
Hang in there...
I'm here for you!
Chihiro: "Hey…"
Shouta: "Hmm?"
Let's do our best
You can quit if it's too hard
Chihiro: "Let's do our best."
Shouta: "...I know."
Chihiro: "You can overcome this, Shou-chan. You might even become friends with Chief Zama eventually."
Chihiro: "You can quit if it's too hard."
Shouta: "...R-Really?"
Chihiro: "No matter what happens, I'll be with you. I'm a housewife now, but I can always go back to work."
Shouta: "..."
Chihiro: "If you lose another kilogram, let's just quit."
Shouta: "...I'm going to stick it out, so don't worry."
Chihiro: "You don't have to push yourself, really."
Shouta: "If I just quit like that, it would look bad for the teacher who recommended me, right?"
Chihiro: "I'll apologize with you."
Shouta: "Besides, the only reason your parents approved our relationship was because I have a stable job as a civil servant..."
Chihiro: "We're now married, so that doesn't matter anymore."
Shouta: "A-Anyway, I'll continue working at the city hall. If I give up over something like this, I'll be useless no matter where I work."
Chihiro: "I thought you would say that."
Shouta: "...Eh?"
Chihiro: "I think you can definitely overcome this, Shou-chan. You might even become friends with Section Chief Zama eventually."
Shouta: "...If we look at it that way, that might be a good opportunity."
Chihiro: "What is?"
Shouta: "I'm sorry, I know this is sudden... but he said he wants to come over tomorrow night."
Chihiro: "Chief Zama?"
Shouta: "He said he wants to see with his own eyes if my brain has really turned pink."
Chihiro: "What does he mean by 'pink brain'?"
Shouta: "Whether I've become an idiot because we're newlyweds."
Chihiro: "...Wow, that's intense."
Shouta: "I think I can refuse, but..."
Chihiro: "I'm welcoming him."
Shouta: "I-It's okay to bring him over?"
Chihiro: "By showing off my cooking skills, Shou-chan might be able to get on his good side. I'll also do my best!"
Shouta: "..."
Chihiro: "Oh, we're having the meal here, right?"
Shouta: "I think so... More importantly, thank you, Chihiro..."
Chihiro: "...?"
Shouta: "For always helping me."
Chihiro: "It's my duty as your wife."
...
*Squelch*...
Chihiro: "Ngh..."
*Squelch*... *squish*... *squish*...
Chihiro: "Ngh..."
Shouta: "U-Ugh..."
Chihiro: "You came, right?"
Shouta: "Y-Yeah..."
Chihiro: "..."
As usual...
Shou-chan pulled out his penis just before ejaculation.
He then splashed his semen on my belly button.
I lovingly play with it with my fingers.
The amount is still quite small as usual.
If a lot came out, I'm sure he would feel even better.
That's why I've also been experimenting with his diet...
But it hasn't changed much.
He never had a strong sex drive to begin with...
Shouta: "...Sorry for cumming so fast again."
Chihiro: "Not at all."
I desperately shake my head.
Chihiro: "It was amazing for me."
Shouta: "I-It felt good for me too"
Chihiro: "...Shall we go to sleep?"
Shouta: "Yeah..."
We turn off the lights and crawl into the futon.
As always, I'm held by Shou-chan.
His chest is skinny, but for me, it's a reliable one.
I'm really happy.
I can fall asleep right away when we're like this...
...

Yuusaku: "..."
Yuusaku: "Damn, are you a moron?"
Don't zoom in on the connected part during the creampie!
Isn't the whole screen now full of mosaic?
You're supposed to focus on the actress's face twisted in agony.
Why are you, a cameraman, getting excited here?
Stupid bastard!
Just die!
If you don't want to die, let me hold the camera.
You're so shitty at this that my dick has gone limp.
Yuusaku: "Hmph..."
I let go of my semi-erect dick and gulped down the rest of my beer.
It's lukewarm and gross.

Damn it!
My snack is a can of tuna.
It's the same one I opened yesterday.
Even in this summer heat, I can still eat like a horse.
My stomach is as strong as my dick.
That's why I haven't eaten any proper food tonight.
Well, whatever...
Tomorrow I'll have dinner at that idiot Akizuki's house.
I might get a decent meal for the first time in a while.
I don't know what kind of woman he married...
But judging from his bento, her cooking skills should be OK.
So even if she looks plain and shabby, I'll put up with it.
Knowing that useless guy...
I'm sure his wife is an ugly woman whose only redeeming quality is being young.
