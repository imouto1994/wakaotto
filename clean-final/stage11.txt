...And two days later...
Yusaku: "Hey, ugly."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "Go buy me a cold beer."
Chihiro: "Again?"
Crash.
Chihiro: "Please don't kick the table."
Yusaku: "...Do you know why I'm in a bad mood?"
Chihiro: "...Yes."
Yusaku: "What's with that swimsuit... huh?"
Chihiro: "I... I can't wear something like that."
Yusaku: "A plain swimsuit and a body wrapped in a towel. Thanks to you, the lecherous official is lying down like a seal, doing nothing."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "You can't be..."
Are you saying I should be grateful just because you came along?
Are you deliberately provoking me to torment you?
Yusaku: "Are you saying I should be grateful just because you came along?"
Chihiro: "N-no one said that."
Yusaku: "Then..."
Yusaku: "Are you deliberately provoking me to torment you?"
Chihiro: "No, that's not it."
Yusaku: "While the husband is playing with the lecherous official's kid, the wife is leisurely sipping on tropical drinks... You've got quite the status."
Chihiro: "I... I don't know what else I'm supposed to do."
Yusaku: "Who are the guests you're entertaining?"
Chihiro: "T-the Debt Bureau officials and their son..."
Yusaku: "Your husband is taking care of the kid's mood. You should understand your role without having to think too deeply, right?"
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "Go play in the water with the lecherous official. I think he'd be thrilled if you invited him."
Chihiro: "M-me? Invite him alone?"
Yusaku: "Of course."
Chihiro: "Please, come with me."
Yusaku: "This is supposed to be an erotic time. I'm not so uncool to disturb it."
Chihiro: "I'd prefer if you were uncool."
Yusaku: "What?"
Chihiro: "I don't like him staring at me. When there's no one else around, his gaze becomes incredibly blatant..."
Yusaku: "That's what a wife is for, isn't it?"
Chihiro: "That's... not..."
Yusaku: "Go already."
Chihiro: "...I don't want to cool my stomach in the water."
Yusaku: "What's that?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Come up with a better excuse, idiot."
Chihiro: "I really can't go in."
Yusaku: "...Why?"
Chihiro: "...I don't want to answer."
Yusaku: "You're not on your period, are you?"
Chihiro: "That's... that's why I don't want to answer."
Yusaku: "If you're on your period, you could stuff cotton in your crotch. With about 10 tampons, you should manage for about an hour."
Chihiro: "...That's a terrible thing to say."
Yusaku: "The restroom is up the slope and at the far left. There's a poster there too, don't forget to stop by next door."
Chihiro: "A poster?... Stop by next door?"
Yusaku: "It's in the men's restroom."
Chihiro: "Why would I go into the men's restroom?"
Yusaku: "I think it would be best if you took it down quickly."
Chihiro: "Eh... eh...?"
Yusaku: "Did you think you'd get off scot-free without wearing the swimsuit I gave you?"
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "..."
Amazing.
She's pale as a ghost.
She's running barefoot at full speed.
It's a shame I can't see her breasts bouncing.
And the tense look on her face too.
...
...
...
Oh.
She came back at the same speed as when she left.
In her hand is a crumpled poster.
Of course, it's my homemade one, made from that data.
She has an expression I've never seen before.
This time, I can see her breasts bouncing perfectly.
The chunks of flesh bouncing up and down violently.
Despite the modest swimsuit, they seem about to spill out.
Chihiro: "Haa... haa... haa..."
Yusaku: "Welcome back."
Chihiro: "What... what is this!?"
Yusaku: "It turned out quite well, didn't it?"
Chihiro: "How could you post something like this in a public place..."
Yusaku: "I've blacked out the parts with your eyes and pussy. No one will know it's you."
Chihiro: "That's not the point!!"
Yusaku: "More importantly, I'm surprised you could enter the men's restroom."
Chihiro: "I don't remember... I was too desperate."
Yusaku: "Don't get so excited."
Chihiro: "How could you... do something so outrageous..."
Yusaku: "...Because I can."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "I've always done it, and I always will."
Chihiro: "Please, no more of this."
Yusaku: "No way."
Chihiro: "What's so fun about doing something like this?"
Yusaku: "While you were in the restroom, I threw your ring into the pool."
Chihiro: "!!"
Yusaku: "You should retrieve it before it gets sucked into the drain."
Chihiro: "No... you're lying..."
Yusaku: "..."
Yusaku: "...hehe."
She makes a beeline for the wave pool this time.
But she doesn't go deep into it.
She stands stunned in water about ankle-deep.
She stands out just by standing.
Her appearance is exceptional, even in a plain swimsuit.
Of course, it's not just me who thinks so.
The guys around here.
Especially the lecherous officials lying about like seals.
They're all looking at her body as if they're licking it.
...
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Have you given up?"
Chihiro: "...Please tell me where you threw it."
Yusaku: "What?"
Chihiro: "The... the ring, of course."
Yusaku: "I still have the ring here."
I smile cheerfully.
I show her the silver ring on my little finger with a relaxed smile.
Chihiro: "You... you tricked me."
Yusaku: "It seems like you really can't go in."
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Yusaku: "Into the water."
Chihiro: "Just to check if..."
Yusaku: "Yes, that's right."
Chihiro: "Enough is enough. Give me back the ring right now."
Yusaku: "Who lost the bet?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "And who didn't keep their promise?"
Chihiro: "But... but..."
Yusaku: "There's not a millimeter of space for you to be assertive."
Chihiro: "...I'm sorry for not keeping my promise."
Yusaku: "You lying woman."
Chihiro: "...What do I have to do for you to give it back?"
Yusaku: "If you can make me want to give it back."
Chihiro: "That's... that's why I'm asking. I don't know."
Yusaku: "Find the answer yourself."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "It's easy if you think about why you came with me."
Chihiro: "...To entertain that man."
Yusaku: "Which man?"
Chihiro: "The... the man from the Ministry of Debt who's lying over there..."
Yusaku: "Right, that sweaty old man who came to the pool and didn't even change into a swimsuit, as if his only purpose was to feast his eyes."
Chihiro: "...I'll go over and talk to him."
Yusaku: "Is that all?"
Chihiro: "I'll... I'll buy him a beer..."
Yusaku: "He's a lightweight."
Chihiro: "Then... then..."
Yusaku: "What about the towel you've been using to cover yourself?"
Chihiro: "...I'm planning to take it off."
Yusaku: "Planning?"
Chihiro: "I... I'll take it off."
Yusaku: "That's the spirit."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Don't forget that this is a form of hospitality."
Chihiro: "Y-Yes."
Yusaku: "..."
Pull yourself together, missus.
Don't keep looking back at me with a face like a scared puppy.
That's right.
As a hostess, you should smile like a sunflower.
Let's start from there.
The distance between me and the lustful official is about 5 meters.
Yet, I can't hear their conversation over the surrounding noise.
All I can rely on is their gestures.
But my chest and groin are swelling with anticipation.
The wife is still standing by the lecherous official.
What is she doing?
She should hurry up and start a conversation.
Chihiro: "Um..."
Finally, Chihiro squats down.
She starts moving her mouth awkwardly.
The lecherous official turns his head without changing his body orientation.
Nice.
His face is shinier than his sweat.
He looked incredibly annoyed when he turned around.
But the moment he saw Chihiro, his expression changed into a grin.
He swiftly moved to secure some space for the missus.
Chihiro timidly sat next to him.
From my perspective, their backs are turned to me.
Still, I can catch a glimpse of their profiles.
He must be really pleased.
The lecherous official is full power from the get-go.
Spitting while desperately talking.
In contrast, Chihiro keeps facing straight ahead.
She just nods earnestly.
Her awkward smile is thrilling.
She must be troubled.
Not knowing how to deal with the situation.
...
Oops.
The lecherous official who had been in the same position as Chihiro.
Suddenly, he leans back and places both hands on the ground.
His arms are deliberately spread wide in a 'ha' shape.
One of his hands is almost touching Chihiro's buttocks.
As expected, he starts moving his fingertips like insects.
Closing the distance to her butt little by little.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Bingo.
Chihiro's hunched back straightens up.
Her face is flustered.
She's panicking and looking back.
Still, the lecherous official doesn't change the position of his hand.
He keeps spitting at Chihiro with an innocent face.
As expected of the infamous lecherous old man in our circle.
He has a history of causing trouble.
Moreover, rumor has it that he's a huge fan of busty women.
He probably feels like he's found a diamond in the sand.
Chihiro: "Ugh...ah..."
Chihiro shifts her buttocks and moves a little forward.
Yet, the finger relentlessly pursues her.
Pretending to be nothing more than an impossible coincidence.
Chihiro: "Nn... ah... hah...!"
Chihiro turns again.
This time not directly behind, but towards me.
Her face even more like a scared puppy than before she sat down.
Asking for help?
I can either ignore her normally
Or stick my tongue out at her.
Too bad.
For me, it's a moment of bliss.
There's no way I'm going to extend a helping hand.
I make a big show of sticking my tongue out.
Be more troubled.
Fidget and worry more.
Chihiro: "..."
She's tenacious.
She's still looking at me.
Her face gradually looks like she's about to cry.
Desperately, Chihiro is asking for permission to move away from the lewd official.
But that's only for a moment.
Without considering Chihiro's situation at all, the lewd official moves to the next step.
Suddenly he brings his mouth close to her ear and starts whispering something.
Chihiro: "!!"
The wife who shrinks her shoulders and tries to escape.
Naturally, her face also turns back to the front.
Completely at the old man's pace.
She's fully occupied just by getting through the situation.
The finger touching her butt also gradually becomes indifferent.
Poor thing.
Unable to complain about the outrageous behavior.
Of course, she's not allowed to stand up either.
Even if he blows stinky breath on her, she can only endure it silently.
It's like a pitfall.
That old man himself.
Does he never let go of the prey he has caught?
Chihiro: "Ah!!"
Oh dear.
He finally pulls Chihiro's shoulder close.
His hand gripping her upper arm remains as it is.
From afar, it looks like they are lovers.
Chihiro shrinks.
She looks back at me many times with a scared face.
It's dangerous, huh.
If her husband sees her in such a situation.
Chihiro: "Nn... ah..."
She must have become unable to bear it.
Chihiro reluctantly removes the arm that is holding her.
Of course, the lewd official is not intimidated at all.
As if taking advantage of the opportunity, he grabs her wrist that tried to push him away.
And brazenly starts whispering in her ear again.
Chihiro: "Ugh... ah..."
Her upper body tries to escape.
Chihiro almost seems to fall sideways.
Chihiro: "!!"
Yusaku: "...?"
What's going on?
Her body, which was leaning, suddenly straightens.
Facing the old man, Chihiro desperately shakes her head.
She moves her still butt and clearly creates distance.
But the lewd official keeps pushing.
It seems he has started to seriously court her despite his age.
Chihiro: "...".
Her gaze once again seeks help from me.
Much more desperate than before.
Her face is beyond fear, drained of color.
Chihiro: "Kyaa...!"
A small scream.
The lewd official, still gripping her wrist, stands up.
He forcefully pulls up the resisting Chihiro.
I purposely avert my eyes to the pool so as not to meet hers.
But of course, I keep the two of them in the corner of my vision.
I clearly catch the sight of Chihiro being taken away.
Chihiro: "Ka, manager... hah..."
That was her anguished voice as she passed by.
Of course, I pretend not to hear.
While conspicuously playing with my phone, I wait for a certain distance to open up.
Only when they're far enough away for me to feign ignorance do I finally start to follow the two of them...
...
What's this?
Where are they going?
Chihiro is being forcefully dragged away.
She's like a town girl being abducted by a corrupt magistrate.
She can't resist strongly.
But she's not obediently following either.
Her feet flail and tangle.
Every time she looks back at me, she almost trips several times.
...
Yusaku: "..."
Probably because it's mealtime.
There's a huge crowd in front of the food stalls.
But the lewd official doesn't slow down.
He's bulldozing his way through.
I might have taken too much distance.
Gradually, the two of them blend into the crowd.
Just before I reach the top of the slope, I completely lose sight of them.
Yusaku: "Tch..."
Where did they go?
Behind the restroom
Looking for lunch at a food stall
Both of them together in the men's restroom
Both of them together in the women's restroom
Yusaku: "..."
Behind the restroom.
From here, I can see dense trees standing tall.
Probably a grove to separate it from the amusement park.
Which means...
Yusaku: "..."
No way.
He's a guy who prioritizes his sexual desires over his appetite.
There's no way Chihiro would desperately shake her head just to go buy some food.
Yusaku: "..."
Both of them together in the men's restroom?
If no one's there, he could pull her in, but people are constantly coming and going.
No matter how you look at it, it's too conspicuous.
It can't be the men's restroom.
If he's planning to do something, he'll definitely choose a place where there are no people.
Yusaku: "..."
Both of them together in the women's restroom?
If no one's there, he could pull her in, but people are constantly coming and going.
If an old man like that walked in, there should at least be a scream.
It's even less likely to be the women's restroom.
If an old man like that came in, there should have been at least one scream.
Yusaku: "..."
A space just wide enough for a person to pass through, between the side wall and the hedge.
While making sure I'm not seen...
I quietly slip my body into it.
Once inside, I'm practically invisible thanks to the thick trees.
At the end there's a wire fence.
If I turn right there, I'll be behind the restroom.
