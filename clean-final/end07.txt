Yuusaku: "..."
Yuusaku: "...?"
Yuusaku: "..."
Yuusaku: "...Hey."
Shouta: "..."
Yuusaku: "What's with the scary face?"
Yuusaku: "..."
He wordlessly goes towards the back room.
But he doesn't go in.
He's just sticking his face through the gap in the sliding door.
Yuusaku: "Uh..."
What?
Something's off.
I can't move my body.
Am I tied up?
My memory is fuzzy, but it's slowly coming back.
That's right.
I think I was hit in the head at the entrance.
Probably not just my clothes, my face must be covered in blood too.
That's why it feels weirdly crunchy when I move my mouth.
Yuusaku: "...Welcome back."
Shouta: "..."
Yuusaku: "So, what's the plan?"
Shouta: "...Who knows."
Yuusaku: "These injuries should be enough, don't you think?"
Shouta: "..."
Yuusaku: "You can apologize later, just untie the ropes on my limbs."
Shouta: "...No."
Yuusaku: "Why not?"
Shouta: "I don't need to explain my reasons."
Yuusaku: "Is that how you speak to your boss?"
Shouta: "You're no longer my boss. Just a perverted and cowardly piece of trash."
Yuusaku: "...You don't hold back, do you."
Shouta: "This is hardly enough to express my feelings."
Yuusaku: "...Is that so."
My brain finally starts to function properly.
Unless I'm a complete idiot, I can imagine how things have unfolded.
This is not good.
Judging by his insolent attitude, it seems I'm still in a tight spot.
Yuusaku: "Where's your wife?"
Shouta: "...I gave her a sedative and put her to sleep."
Yuusaku: "I see..."
Just as I thought.
In that case, I can't just sit still.
I try to twist my wrists without being noticed.
Somehow, I'm trying to at least free my arms.
Yuusaku: "Do you understand what you're doing?"
Shouta: "I think that's my line."
Yuusaku: "Are you saying I did something?"
Shouta: "It's pointless to play dumb now."
Yuusaku: "I don't understand what you're saying."
Shouta: "...Chihiro told me everything."
Yuusaku: "What did she tell you?"
Shouta: "Ugh, I don't even want to say it. If I could, I'd go back two weeks in time and kill you."
Yuusaku: "...That's quite a dangerous thing to say."
Shouta: "I have every right to say that, don't I? Right? Right?"
Yuusaku: "Just calm down."
Shouta: "Huff... huff... ah..."
Yuusaku: "You won't even hear my side of the story, I'm the only bad guy here."
Shouta: "Uh, I smelled semen from her genitals."
Yuusaku: "It's probably the leftover scent from when you ejaculated."
Shouta: "What did you insert? It was red and swollen."
Yuusaku: "You must have played with it with your dirty fingers."
Shouta: "Then why does my shirt smell like urine!?"
Yuusaku: "(Ugh...)"
What he's holding is a large pair of scissors.
Where was he hiding something like this?
Shouta: "I was starting to respect you... starting to trust you as a boss..."
Yuusaku: "That's why I'm telling you to calm down."
Shouta: "Ughhh..."
The idiot started circling around me.
His face was like a demon's.
This is getting worse.
It's clearly not scissors to cut the rope.
I don't care if he's noticed.
I desperately twist my wrists.
Twisting with all my might.
Shouta: "...I'm going to do this to you."
The demon-like guy suddenly stopped.
He pointed the tip of the scissors at me and approached like a zombie.
This is bad.
His eyes have completely lost sanity.
Staring...
Yuusaku: "Hey, hey."
It would be strange not to panic.
He aimed his unfocused gaze at my crotch.
Without hesitation, he began to unzip me.
Yuusaku: "Wa, wait..."
Calm down.
He's not normal right now.
I take a deep breath.
Suppressing my fear, I force myself to appear calm.
Yuusaku: "...Didn't know you had that kind of fetish."
Shouta: "..."
Yuusaku: "Are you going to give me a blowjob?"
Shouta: "The most unacceptable part is here, isn't it?"
Rustle... Rustle...
Yuusaku: "St... Stop this foolishness."
Shouta: "...Divine punishment."
Yuusaku: "I told you to stop!"
Snip.
Yuusaku: "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"
It got cut off.
My penis, the second most important thing in my life.
Yuusaku: "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"
I rolled around like a firecracker.
It hurts.
It hurts.
It hurts so much I could die.
It's far worse than when I was hit in the head.
Yuusaku: "Guh, guh, you... bastard..."
Shouta: "This was inside Chihiro... this was inside Chihiro..."
A piece of flesh held between his fingers.
He slammed it onto the floor with a splat.
He's about to crush it under his foot right now.
Yuusaku: "Ugh..."
Don't joke around.
Yuusaku: "I'm gonna kill you and Chihiro too."
The moment the intent to kill filled my entire body.
From all the thrashing, my body became blood-stained.
My wrist slipped out of the rope that was starting to loosen.
However, my legs are still bound.
In addition, I'm barely breathing.
Still, with a desperate look, I roll towards his feet.
I managed to snatch the piece of flesh just before it was about to be crushed.
Yuusaku: "My... my penis..."
The miserably shrunken glans.
There's no trace left of its former vigor.
Yuusaku: "Ugh... ugh..."
For some reason, I don't even try to untie the rope on my legs.
I don't even think about taking the scissors away from him.
I just sit down in an awkward position.
Desperately trying to reattach my penis.
Yuusaku: "Ugh... it won't stick."
The cut surface is jagged.
On top of that, fresh blood is spurting out from the base of the remaining part.
But the pain from before has disappeared as if it was a lie.
Now it feels like my senses are numbed, only tingling.
Yuusaku: "...You... bastard."
Shouta: "..."
I look up at him with resentful eyes.
He looks down at me coldly in response.
Ugh.
Yuusaku: "!!"
I got kicked.
In the jaw.
Yuusaku: "Guh..."
I fall down on my back.
The ceiling I saw when I straddled Chihiro, looked strangely white.
Yuusaku: "..."
There's no longer a fluorescent light there.
Even the boundary with the wall has disappeared.
...
I see.
I can't see anything.
I'm just on the verge of death.
It's not surprising with all the blood I've lost.
There's no way an ambulance would be called in this situation.
I'll probably never see the morning again.
But that's okay.
I was able to violate the wife.
The husband who finished me off is a murderer.
Everything is messed up.
No one can be happy.
Compared to that, I still have a dream.
To die quickly and be reborn quickly.
Next time as the wife's child.
When I come out of the womb, I'll defile her vagina again...
