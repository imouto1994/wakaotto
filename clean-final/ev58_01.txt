Chihiro: "Nng... Chupa... Hah..."
With moist eyes, I acted enticingly.
That's why I opened my mouth wider than ever before.
In a place where I can hear the voice of my beloved husband.
I take in the chief's penis into my throat once more.
Chihiro: "Uh... guh..."
I choked.
I pushed myself too hard.
Yuusaku: "...Akizuki."
Shouta: "Y-Yes."
Yuusaku: "It might be odd for a single guy like me to say this, but showing gratitude to your wife can't be done with words alone."
Shouta: "I-I understand."
Yuusaku: "You should occasionally take her on a trip or something."
Shouta: "I-I would love to, if we had a substantial amount of time."
Yuusaku: "It's because you're saying such leisurely things that your actions don't follow."
Shouta: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "...Am I wrong?"
Shouta: "I-I'm sorry."
Yuusaku: "The upcoming holiday is perfect, isn't it?"
Shouta: "Eh?"
Yuusaku: "When will there be more time like this?"
Shouta: "E-Even if you suddenly say such a thing..."
Yuusaku: "Decisions like this are made on the spot."
Shouta: "I-I see..."
Yuusaku: "By that time, your work at the Finance Bureau will have settled down, right?"
Shouta: "Uh... yes... well..."
Yuusaku: "In a few months, her belly will start to show, so I think now's the time to go on a trip."
Shouta: "..."
Shouta: "...That's certainly true."
Chihiro: "Nng... Nn..."
Shouta: "Chihiro."
Chihiro: "Nn..."
Shouta: "Is there any place you want to go?"
Chihiro: "Nn... Chupa... Nn..."
Shouta: "...Chihiro?"
Chihiro: "!?"
