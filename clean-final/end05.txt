...Two days later, early in the morning...
Ding-dong.
Yusaku: "..."
Ding-dong.
Yusaku: "...?"
Ding-dong.
Who is it?
It's not even 6 in the morning yet.
Ding-dong.
Yusaku: "..."
Unfamiliar guys appear on the intercom.
I discreetly peer outside through the gap in the curtains.
...
What the hell?
What on earth is going on?
Feels like I'm having a bad dream.
A wagon with an 88 number plate is parked securely.
Considering the time, it can't be good.
What should I do?
Should I run?
And run to where?
Yusaku: "Tch..."
Shut up.
I'll open it.
It's okay if I open it, right?
Click...
Police Officer: "Yusaku Zama?"
Yusaku: "...What do you want this early in the morning?"
Police Officer: "Here, this is the search warrant."
Yusaku: "Huh?"
Two young men standing behind.
They push me aside and trample into the room.
Yusaku: "What are you trying to do?"
Police Officer: "Sorry, but could you come with us voluntarily?"
Yusaku: "...I don't want to."
Police Officer: "Then stay put right there."
Yusaku: "Do you have the right to do that?"
Police Officer: "Yes, I do."
Even though his voice is gruff, he smiles.
He definitely looks like he's not an ordinary guy.
Yusaku: "Your gaze is too harsh, you know."
Police Officer: "You're quite a piece of work yourself."
Yusaku: "Hmph..."
Young Police Officer: "Chief Tsuzuki, we've found it!"
Police Officer: "What did you find?"
Young Police Officer: "We have confirmed the victim's photo."
Police Officer: "And the ring?"
Young Police Officer: "We haven't found that yet."
Police Officer: "...Where did you hide it?"
Yusaku: "Feel free to search for it yourself."
Police Officer: "Then you'll just be in the way. It's a bit early, but why don't you come with us?"
Yusaku: "If you're going to do it, put a hood on me."
Police Officer: "Why would we need to do that?"
Yusaku: "...If you don't handcuff me, I'll resist."
Police Officer: "People who resist usually do so before they say they will."
Yusaku: "Forget about that, just do it for the memory."
Police Officer: "...You're a strange one, aren't you?"
Yusaku: "...The more memories, the better, right?"
Police Officer: "Well, since we found the photo, I'm arresting you on the spot."
Grind...
Police Officer: "At 6:08 AM, the suspect has been secured..."
Yusaku: "..."
Nice.
It's like watching a drama unfold.
But it's not the ending yet.
My dear lady.
Is this what you do when you lose a bet?
I won't forget.
The weight of the handcuffs on my wrist.
The cold, emotionless chill.
Police Officer: "Let's go."
Yusaku: "...Don't pull me like that."
Police Officer: "Do you want a towel?"
Yusaku: "I don't need anything like that."
For a while, I'll say goodbye to the outside world.
I'm looking forward to coming back.
Don't divorce before then.
I'm truly wishing for your marital happiness, you know.
A warm family home.
A cheerful dining table.
A living room filled with laughter.
You'd better polish it up.
That marital love you idealized, my lady.
Preferably at the height of happiness.
I'll destroy it then.
Of course, this time there won't be any intro.
Right in front of your husband.
Your screaming, crying wife.
I'll have her gang-raped by about a hundred men...
