Yuusaku: "..."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "Welcome."
Chihiro: "...E, excuse me for intruding."
Yuusaku: "So?"
Chihiro: "...Huh?"
Yuusaku: "What's the price for letting me search?"
Chihiro: "Uh..."
As I expected.
This is what I get the moment I enter the room.
Yuusaku: "Shall we decide by a bet again?"
Chihiro: "W, wait... that's not what we discussed..."
The devil looks awfully pleased.
He opens the closet and starts searching for something.
A chill runs down my spine, an ominous feeling.
And just as I thought that,
I let out a deep sigh as the situation unfolds just as I'd feared.
Yuusaku: "The rules are the same as last time."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
He brings out that swimsuit again.
I don't want to wear that anymore.
No matter how many times we do this, the result is the same.
He knows he can't lose, but he provokes me anyway.
Yuusaku: "If you win, I'll let you search the room."
Chihiro: "I, I can't..."
Yuusaku: "It's not good to give up before the game even starts."
The devil is full of enthusiasm.
Nothing I say will make a difference in times like these.
Anyone could see that, just by looking at our past encounters.
What should I do?
If I lose, there's no point in coming here.
But I don't have any confidence that I can win.
Yuusaku: "I'll give you a 10-minute handicap."
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "I'll stay still during that time. Will you accept the bet then?"
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "You're hesitant."
Chihiro: "But..."
Yuusaku: "Not just the search, I'll even quit my job."
Chihiro: "...I don't need that."
Yuusaku: "You don't want me to stay by your husband's side, right?"
Chihiro: "Unless it's a police matter, I think it's impossible."
Yuusaku: "Why's that?"
Chihiro: "I remember Shō-chan saying... Your father is the top of the personnel department."
Yuusaku: "..."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
What?
For a moment, he had a look in his eyes I'd never seen before.
The piercing look quickly receded.
A dark shadow fell in his eyes.
Yuusaku: "...So that's what you meant."
Chihiro: "A, anyway, I don't need that."
Yuusaku: "Let's decide what you're going to do then, Mrs."
Chihiro: "...Me?"
Yuusaku: "What will you do if you lose?"
Chihiro: "Isn't wearing that swimsuit enough?"
Yuusaku: "That's like your battle gear, isn't it?"
Chihiro: "That's... not..."
Yuusaku: "Offer up something that's important to you."
Chihiro: "E, even if you say that out of the blue..."
Yuusaku: "If you're indecisive again, I might change my mind. I might not just bet, I might take more direct action..."
Chihiro: "A, ah..."
Something important to me.
I'm at a loss.
I can't think of anything right away.
If there is something...
My wedding ring
My body
Chihiro: "Uh..."
I'm such a fool.
What a fool I am.
Who would use their wedding ring as a bet?
If I ever let go of this, it would only be when I've sorted out my feelings.
Considering what I've done, I think that's the right thing to do.
In fact, I was thinking about that all last night.
I even pretended to pull it off my finger.
But...
I still don't know what to do.
I just can't find a way to make myself the only one unhappy...
I just can't find a way to make myself the only one unhappy.
Anyway, the ring is out of the question.
I have to think of something else.
Chihiro: "Uh..."
I'm such a fool.
What a fool I am.
That's already been taken from me.
Yuusaku: "...Decide quickly."
Chihiro: "I, I can't think of anything."
Yuusaku: "You lead a pretty boring life, don't you?"
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "Don't you have at least one important item?"
Chihiro: "..."
Item?
It's somehow become limited to that.
Of course, that's far better than being asked for some strange act.
I need to end this conversation quickly before the devil changes his mind.
Chihiro: "Um..."
Yuusaku: "..."
Chihiro: "Uh, um..."
Yuusaku: "Quit stalling..."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Something important.
Something important, something important.
....
I've got it.
The picture we took on our first date
Chihiro: "..."
What a fool I am.
I'm such a fool it's killing me.
I shouldn't sacrifice my memories with Shō-chan.
Even if it's just a picture, I shouldn't involve him.
I need to choose something more personal.
Yuusaku: "Do you really need to think that hard to come up with something?"
Stare...
Chihiro: "Eek..."
Stop it.
He's unzipping his pants.
I don't want to see his penis anymore.
Of course, I don't want to touch it or have it inside me.
I need to come up with something quickly.
Something important to me.
Something only I consider important...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yuusaku: "...Did you find it?"
Chihiro: "But... to you... it's totally..."
Yuusaku: "Just say it."
Chihiro: "..."
A green ribbon
Chihiro: "...A green... ribbon."
Yuusaku: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "A, a green ribbon."
Yuusaku: "What's that?"
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "The ribbon you wear in your hair?"
Chihiro: "..."
He looks at me like I'm a joke.
I should not have said it.
Yuusaku: "That's important to you?"
Chihiro: "Is, is that not okay?"
Yuusaku: "...Why are you getting so worked up?"
Chihiro: "I'm, I'm not getting worked up."
Yuusaku: "You looked annoyed."
Chihiro: "I'm not really..."
Yuusaku: "...I have to punish cheeky women."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
I'm done for.
I'm going to be violated again.
It always ends up like this.
Stare...
Chihiro: "...?"
Huh?
He's zipping his pants back up.
Why?
Maybe he'll forgive me if I just touch it?
Yuusaku: "How was it?"
Chihiro: "..."
???
I don't even know what he's asking.
Yuusaku: "The action you thought was typical of me."
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "You thought I was going to violate you again, didn't you."
Chihiro: "Eh...eh...?"
I'm speechless.
My mouth is wide open.
Yuusaku: "It's because you're so suspicious, it's annoying. Well, considering what's been done to you, it's natural."
Yuusaku: "I'm going to do some laundry while I change, so feel free to investigate on your own. But don't mess up the room."
Chihiro: "..."
This is terrible.
Even for a tease, this is too much.
Someone stop the shaking of my body.
If I relax even a little, I feel like I might collapse.
Chihiro: "(What a jerk...)"
I glared at the devil's back.
The sight of him loosening his tie, humming a tune.
His selfish attitude is increasingly infuriating.
Chihiro: "Uh..."
I should just ignore him.
He's a barbarian with no sense of delicacy.
I'm the fool for being angry.
I took a deep breath to calm myself down.
I looked around the room again.
A cluttered sight.
It definitely looks like a man living alone.
Where to start with this, it'd be strange not to be confused.
But just staring won't give me peace of mind.
The last time I was called to this room, my poster was plastered all over the wall.
There's a chance that it's still there.
Chihiro: "..."
Check around the bed
Check around the TV
Check behind the curtain
Check the laptop
Check around the table
Check the left rack
Check the right rack
Check inside the trash bin
Chihiro: "Uh..."
It smells like a man.
Just getting closer made me think that.
I pinched the sheets with my fingertips and lifted them slightly.
Then I just peeked into the gap underneath.
I can't exactly disassemble the bed.
That's about all I can do.
Chihiro: "..."
A big TV.
I knelt on the floor.
I tried to peek inside the rack.
Cotton dust floating with a slight movement.
It seems like it hasn't been cleaned for months.
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Wow.
There are a lot of adult DVDs lined up.
I wonder what's so fun about watching these.
Chihiro: "..."
I stood between the rack and the bed.
I peeked behind the curtain a little.
There's a big window.
Seeing the bright outside, I finally get a sense of time.
Why doesn't he open it?
The bed is in front of the window anyway.
Strange.
Chihiro: "..."
A laptop in the corner of the room.
Of course, it's not turned on.
I hesitate if I should just use it freely.
What should I do.
...
I've decided.
This seems to take time, so I'll leave it for later.
I'll have him show me under his supervision.
Chihiro: "..."
Full of things, top and bottom.
If you tidy up, it should take less than 5 minutes.
Why is he so sloppy?
It's something that can be handled with just a bit of consideration.
A convenience store bag left casually.
Inside was unopened retort food.
My eyes naturally went to the kitchen.
Bottles, cans, and PET bottles next to the sink.
They're piled up like a mountain.
It seems he doesn't even separate when throwing away.
He's a nuisance to everyone, not just me.
Chihiro: "Sigh..."
I sighed, even though it's none of my business.
He could tidy up a little more.
The types of things are all jumbled up.
If it's just cluttered, that's still fine.
Several pieces of underwear covered in dust.
Next to it, a bottle of soy sauce is left.
Of course, it's still full.
And if you look closely, the color is off.
Is it rotten?
Chihiro: "..."
I stood in front of the rack.
I peer into the gap between objects.
Of course, I hold my breath.
Even a slight fluctuation in the air seems to stir up the dust.
That's why I deliberately turn around to breathe.
It feels kind of silly.
A handheld mop, dumped in the corner of the room, is annoying.
If he's not going to use it, he shouldn't have bought it.
Yuusaku: "There's nothing suspicious anywhere, right?"
The devil's voice from a distance.
It doesn't sound like he's saying it seriously.
So I decide to ignore it boldly.
Chihiro: "(Next is...)"
Chihiro: "...?"
The door to the bathroom is left open.
I involuntarily turn at the sound coming from there.
The devil is down to his underwear before I know it.
His back is turned.
He's rummaging around by the washing machine.
A pile of clothes in the basket beside him.
It looks like about a week's worth.
I grimace so as not to be noticed.
I retaliate just a little with my expression.
Serves him right.
It's his fault for not washing regularly.
I know men can't help it, but still.
Chihiro: "..."
Speaking of which, before we got married.
I used to go to Sho's room on Sundays and often did his laundry for him.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Now's not the time to be lost in memories.
I need to investigate until I'm satisfied, to convince myself.
Clang, thud... clang...
Chihiro: "...?"
The sound of the washing drum starting.
The way he put the clothes in must be off-balance, the sound is unusually loud.
The devil is still just in his underwear as usual.
I wish he'd change quickly because it bothers me.
Not that I have any right to complain.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Was that fabric softener just now?
Without even measuring with a cap, he tilted the container and poured it in directly.
And a large amount at that.
This is why men are no good.
If there's too much, the clothes can't absorb water well.
The dirt won't come off properly either.
For a moment, I think about warning him.
But I immediately retract that thought.
This man is someone I can't hate enough.
He deserves to keep wearing filthy clothes.
Chihiro: "!?"
I was surprised.
He suddenly walked past me.
The devil, in his underwear, goes to the next room.
I can see him opening the closet through the gap in the door.
I'm relieved.
It seems I don't need to worry unnecessarily anymore.
He didn't touch my butt when we passed each other.
It feels like he's not even including me in his field of vision anymore.
I'd sort of noticed it on the train.
His attitude has clearly changed.
Will there be no more torment?
Is my embarrassment over?
If so, I'd be happy.
I wouldn't need to live in pointless fear.
I could even search the room without distraction.
I'm really glad.
Yuusaku: "...Hey."
Chihiro: "Y-Yes."
Once again, I'm startled.
A shiver runs up my spine.
The devil has emerged from the next room.
It's as if he alone has fast-forwarded time.
Before I know it, he's already dressed in a new suit.
Yuusaku: "Take care when you leave."
Chihiro: "...Huh?"
A key is thrown at me, tracing a loose parabola.
I have no choice but to catch it, of course.
Instinctively, I extend my arm and receive it.
Chihiro: "W-What does this mean?"
Yuusaku: "It means I'm asking you to lock up. Just throw the key in the mailbox or something."
Chihiro: "..."
Chihiro: "...W-Wait a minute, please."
The devil is already heading for the entrance.
I call out to stop him, quite flustered.
Yuusaku: "Sorry, but I've got to go now."
Chihiro: "But, the data on your laptop..."
Yuusaku: "Didn't I tell you to do as you like?"
Click...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Slam.
Chihiro: "..."
He's gone.
It's a truth that seems like a lie.
What the heck.
I can't believe it.
Why do I have to be alone?
This isn't even my house.
Chihiro: "Sigh..."
The washing machine is noisily rattling.
It's making me incredibly irritated.
Did he possibly leave it washing?
From what I saw, it's not the type integrated with a dryer.
If you leave the laundry without drying it, it'll smell...
Chihiro: "..."
It doesn't matter.
Why should I care?
Let it smell.
Enough already.
Now that it's come to this, I'll thoroughly check everything.
I'll pick up every single thing left here.
Confirm the contents of everything from start to finish.
I won't care if he complains later.
It's the devil's fault for leaving me behind.
...
...
...
Chihiro: "..."
Chihiro: "...Phew."
Two hours have passed since then.
The clock's hands already point to 4 in the afternoon.
I'm a bit tired.
I really did check every nook and cranny.
But I'm satisfied with the result.
There wasn't a single thing left that involved me.
Chihiro: "...I should go home."
I switch off the air conditioner.
Finally, I take a look around the room.
Chihiro: "...?"
Huh?
Doesn't the room's atmosphere feel slightly different than when I arrived?
...
This isn't good.
It's probably because I checked too carefully.
When I put things back.
I tend to arrange them more neatly than they were.
I used a handheld mop a little because I didn't want to inhale dust.
All these actions were compelled by necessity.
But I wouldn't want to be misunderstood.
...
Well, it doesn't matter.
It's not like I consciously did it.
That slovenly devil.
He's probably not sensitive enough to notice the changes.
I dim the lights.
I trudge alone to the entrance.
In a situation where there's no one but me.
The closer I get to leaving, the stronger the sense of discomfort somehow becomes.
Click... Slam...
Chihiro: "..."
As instructed, I lock the door.
Checking to make sure it's properly locked.
But the problem is what comes next.
What should I do?
Can I really put it in the mailbox?
He probably has a spare key, I think.
But I'm afraid he might nitpick about something again.
It would be a disaster if it was lost.
If I could, I'd rather return it to him directly...
Chihiro: "..."
I've decided.
I quietly put the key in my pocket.
And silently descend the stairs.
...
Chihiro: "..."
It's strange.
Even after going outside, I can't calm down.
I should be able to feel relieved.
I've checked the room thoroughly and found nothing.
Yet I'm irritated.
What on earth happened?
Is it because I have the key?
Chihiro: "..."
No, that's not it.
That's simply a matter of returning it.
Maybe I'm just annoyed with myself right now.
I'm a woman who was raped last night.
Yet I'm already walking outside with a calm face.
I'm sure I don't like that.
Chihiro: "(But...)"
It's not like I was having fun.
Even though it happened unexpectedly, I accomplished my goal.
All to alleviate my own anxiety.
I don't think I need to feel guilty.
So why?
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
I'm troubled.
The more I think, the more irritated I become.
Enough to kick a pebble while walking.
Even though I might be released from this nightmare.
Now I'm tormented by emotions I can't understand.
Why am I like this?
After my body, is my heart also out of control?
Chihiro: "Ah..."
This isn't good.
I've been spacing out.
I was supposed to be heading for the station, but I've wandered into a strange street.
My stupidity is appropriate for my current self.
Even trying to laugh at myself sardonically, my cheek muscles won't lift.
I can't even properly head to my intended destination.
I might as well keep walking like this, recklessly.
I should just get so embarrassed by myself that I can't go home...
...
...
...
...The same day, 10 PM...
Shouta: "Chief Sazama."
Yuusaku: "...What is it?"
Shouta: "It's about the summer festival this weekend..."
Yuusaku: "Didn't I leave that to you?"
Shouta: "The, the mutual aid fund has been budgeted. The problem is the annual stalls, no one is volunteering..."
Yuusaku: "Which department?"
Shouta: "Uh, no...just us..."
Yuusaku: "Only the Finance Bureau?"
Shouta: "...Yes."
Yuusaku: "Damn it."
Shouta: "I'm, I'm sorry."
Yuusaku: "Setting up a stall with the locals is a way of saving face for the neighborhood association."
Shouta: "Ye, yes..."
Yuusaku: "If we fail in our obligations, it will cause various inconveniences later. Especially since our bureau deals with land."
Shouta: "I, I understand that."
Yuusaku: "Just setting up one stall will be enough. You can manage that much."
Shouta: "Yes, sir."
Yuusaku: "What kind of stall are we setting up this year?"
Shouta: "Since last year's takoyaki stall was well received, this year we'll do the same..."
Yuusaku: "What about the Personnel Bureau?"
Shouta: "Uh, um, I think they're doing yakisoba..."
Yuusaku: "Then we'll do yakisoba too."
Shouta: "Are, are we going head to head?"
Yuusaku: "Not just going head to head, we're going to crush them. Last year we got first place in the children's popularity vote, so naturally, you're aiming for two years in a row, right?"
Shouta: "Of, of course..."
Yuusaku: "...You can't brag to the person in charge last year if it's the same takoyaki."
Shouta: "I'll, I'll try my best to live up to your expectations."
Yuusaku: "...That's fine."
Shouta: "Yes..."
Yuusaku: "As a reward for your declaration, I'll arrange the ingredients. You just take care of the people."
Shouta: "..."
Yuusaku: "What's wrong?"
Shouta: "Th, thank you..."
Yuusaku: "There's no need to tear up."
Shouta: "I'm really glad to be working under you, Chief."
Yuusaku: "I get it, now go. If you don't finish your work quickly, you'll miss the last train."
Shouta: "I'm sorry for adding to your workload when you're busy with the Ministry of Debt."
Yuusaku: "...That will be sorted out soon."
Shouta: "But, but there was a call from the vice-director today too..."
Yuusaku: "We'll be done with that soon enough. I've got it all planned out, so you don't have to worry."
Shouta: "You're amazing, manager."
The gaze of admiration from this idiot.
To be honest, it's really annoying.
Shouta: "What steps do you take to convince the other party at times like this?"
Yuusaku: "First, get to know your enemy."
Shouta: "Note, note..."
Yuusaku: "Then, find their weaknesses and exploit them."
Shouta: "I see..."
Yuusaku: "If you can't break through from the front, aim for the side. If the side doesn't work, attack from the back."
Shouta: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "It means that you can't always go by the book. You've got a role now, so you'll experience this sooner or later whether you like it or not."
Shouta: "I'll be counting on you when that time comes."
Yuusaku: "The tuition fee will be high."
Shouta: "I believe it's worth that much."
Yuusaku: "You don't say..."
Shouta: "I want to become a man who can do his job like you, manager."
Yuusaku: "Really..."
The words he spews out are different from before.
He's getting creepily close every day.
Yuusaku: "You must be tired today, having to take over for me. Go home to your wife early."
Shouta: "Yes, sir."
Yuusaku: "..."
Yuusaku: "Wait a minute."
Shouta: "What is it?"
Yuusaku: "You see..."
It's nothing
What kind of person is your uncle?
Yuusaku: "It's nothing."
Shouta: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "Give my regards to your wife."
Shouta: "Y-Yes..."
Yuusaku: "..."
I almost asked something stupid.
Yuusaku: "What kind of person is your uncle?"
Shouta: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "You have at least one in your relatives, don't you?"
Shouta: "Even if you ask me what kind of person... he's just a regular uncle."
Yuusaku: "Is he related to you by blood?"
Shouta: "Yes, he is."
Yuusaku: "What about on your wife's side?"
Shouta: "I have never met Chihiro's uncle."
Yuusaku: "Why is that?"
Shouta: "W-Well, um... as I mentioned a bit before... it was kind of a forcible marriage..."
Yuusaku: "I see..."
Shouta: "N-No, um... It was actually a bit of a forcible marriage... so I don't really interact with my wife's relatives..."
Yuusaku: "What's that about?"
Shouta: "Ah, I'm sorry."
Yuusaku: "It's not something you should apologize to me for."
Shouta: "Yes, you're right."
Yuusaku: "I'm sorry for stopping you with such a strange question."
Shouta: "No, no, I'll be taking my leave then, Section Chief..."
Yuusaku: "..."
Yuusaku: "...Damn."
I went and asked a stupid question.
Even without blood relations, there are plenty of uncles around.
It's not something that can be figured out just by probing.
The next time I stick my penis in her.
Letting her reveal it mixed with her gasps is the best.
But right now, the top priority is to ferment her M attributes.
In order to do that, it's necessary to leave her alone for a while.
So I have to hold back for a few days.
Of course, I'll not neglect the checks in between.
I'll diligently sprinkle the powder that further inflates her.
Probably the chance will come this weekend.
Just watch.
He will almost certainly become a yakisoba vendor.
Then his wife will be alone at home.
It's the ideal situation to pierce her again.
I'm looking forward to it.
The next time we have sex.
What are you going to tell me?
With that body of yours, carrying that trauma, so obscene...
...
Ding-dong.
Chihiro: "Yes?"
Chihiro: "Welcome home."
Shouta: "I'm home."
He heads to the living room with a smile.
It's past 11 PM.
And yet his face doesn't show any sign of fatigue.
Shouta: "How's your body feeling?"
Chihiro: "Eh?"
Shouta: "Weren't you supposed to go for a regular check-up today...?"
Chihiro: "Ye-yeah... everything's... fine..."
Shouta: "I'm glad."
Chihiro: "..."
It hurts.
His innocently smiling face pierces deeply into my conscience.
Chihiro: "... Do you want to take a bath first?"
Shouta: "Before that, I would like to..."
Chihiro: "..."
A bad premonition.
Shouta: "...Actually, I want to discuss something."
Chihiro: "Wh-what is it?"
Shouta: "Could we postpone the plan to go back to the countryside this weekend?"
Chihiro: "..."
It doesn't seem to be a terrifying conversation.
Including Shouta's proposal, I feel a sigh of relief.
Chihiro: "...Is it about the once-a-month business trip?"
Shouta: "You know about the annual summer festival event, right?"
Chihiro: "Yeah..."
Shouta: "I think I'll probably end up running a stall."
Chihiro: "You, Shouta?"
Shouta nods and moves to the front of the closet.
For some reason, he stands still in front of the door, staring at his reflection in the mirror.
Shouta: "After being told so much, I have to do it myself. Today, the section manager's words really hit me."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
This time I really have a bad feeling.
Chihiro: "Did... Did he say something weird to you?"
Shouta: "No, he just put a comfortable pressure on me. People who are good at their jobs really know how to handle their subordinates, don't they?"
Chihiro: "...Even someone like him is capable at his job."
Shouta: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "Ah..."
That's not good.
I unintentionally muttered something nasty.
Because Shouta was praising him so much...
I ended up saying something like 'someone like him'.
Chihiro: "So, the section manager is a competent person."
Shouta: "Absolutely."
Chihiro: "...I see."
Shouta: "That's why I have to work hard to meet his expectations. If I leave it to someone else and miss out on being the top seller, it could really damage my reputation."
Chihiro: "..."
He finally starts to loosen his tie.
Even while he's doing that, he's nodding at his reflection in the mirror, as if to pump himself up.
Chihiro: "I'll adjust to your schedule, Shouta."
Shouta: "I'm sorry for being so presumptuous."
Chihiro: "No, no... not at all."
Shouta: "I think I'll just take a shower today."
He quickly strips down to his underwear.
Shouta heads to the bathroom with a smile on his face.
I put on a forced smile as well.
I'm watching his back as he leaves.
Chihiro: "..."
I'm sorry.
The one who should be apologizing is me.
I'm actually relieved that I don't have to go back to his parents' house.
The long-awaited homecoming, meant to announce my pregnancy.
Of course, it was Shouta who suggested it.
I agreed without thinking at the time.
But afterwards, I was increasingly feeling down.
Even without that, my body feels tainted.
There's no way I could happily announce this with such a body.
Chihiro: "Haah..."
I head to the entrance with a sigh.
I line up his worn-out shoes.
Just this act alone stirs up feelings of disgust.
I hate playing the role of a dutiful wife.
Everything is full of lies.
There's no end to the little things.
Even when I welcomed Shouta home earlier.
He probably thinks I've been at home the whole time.
But in truth, I hadn't even been back in my room for an hour.
Until then, I had been aimlessly wandering around the station.
Being called out by strange people.
And each time, I would quickly walk away.
But it's better than being alone at home.
Strangely, it's more calming to be frightened.
Chihiro: "..."
That's right.
The weird ones aren't the ones who call out, but me.
Each time I realize this, I see the face of a mocking devil.
Before I know it, I'm muttering curses under my breath.
Scum.
Pervert.
Idiot.
Just disappear.
Insults keep coming to mind.
For some reason, I was able to curse more severely than during the rape.
It's been like this...
Ever since I left the devil's house.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Speaking of the devil's house, I remembered.
The key is still in my pocket.
It would be a problem if I forget and wash it.
I have to put it somewhere until the time comes to return it.
Chihiro: "..."
I'm a bit lost.
I can't leave it where Shouta could see.
But I also can't put it somewhere I'd forget.
That leaves only one place.
The small chest next to the indoor plant.
I gently open the drawer.
I take out a shellwork casket from inside.
It'll be safe here.
But just to be sure, I put it in a place where it can't be seen even if the lid is open.
I put the key in the bottom space that is divided into two.
That's a special place for me.
It's filled with small treasures full of memories.
The earrings I first received from Shouta.
And the notes he casually left for me.
Of course, the green ribbon is also here.
Chihiro: "..."
Thinking about it, it's been a while since I've looked at it.
I gently pinch the end of the pin with my finger.
I pretend to attach it to my left chest like that time.
It feels nostalgic.
My face reflected in the small mirror.
I have grown up, but I was still smiling.
Chihiro: "(...It's not pretending to be devoted)"
I just want to do it.
I return the ribbon to the casket.
I gently place it in a place away from the key so they don't stick together.
I need to start reheating the meal soon.
As long as I wear this ring, I am Shouta's wife.
My sincere feelings towards him.
This is the only thing that hasn't changed no matter what.
