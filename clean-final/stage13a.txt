...2:00 AM...
Chihiro: "..."
Shota: "Uh... burp..."
Chihiro: "Can't sleep?"
Shota: "I... I think I ate too much..."
Chihiro: "Do you want me to get you some stomach medicine?"
Shota: "No... I'm fine..."
Chihiro: "..."
Sure, he ate about three servings while tasting it.
But that's not the only reason he can't sleep.
He can't get the yakisoba off his mind for a moment.
Before I knew it, I was mumbling the order of the seasoning in my mouth.
I head to the living room without turning on the lights.
I take a bag of stomach medicine from the drawer.
Next, I put water and ice in a glass.
I put it on a tray and quietly place it next to his pillow.
Chihiro: "I just prepared it."
Shota: "Ah, thanks..."
By the way...
Chihiro: "What?"
Shota: "We can't start with high heat, can we?"
Chihiro: "The griddle should be hot enough to smoke. When frying the noodles, turn it down to low heat, then gradually increase it."
Shota: "Is the Shaoxing wine after frying the pork?"
Chihiro: "...Correct."
Shota: "Oh, good."
Chihiro: "You practiced enough, you'll be fine."
Shota: "...Yeah."
Chihiro: "Relax, relax."
Shota: "Ugh... understood... I'm going to sleep now."
Chihiro: "..."
Shota: "..."
Sure, his murmuring voice has stopped.
But now he's incredibly restless.
He changes his position every few seconds.
He's furrowing his brow as if he's in the middle of work.
A face that doesn't seem to be sleeping.
If this goes on, he'll just get tired lying down.
Chihiro: "..."
My gaze goes to the clock next to the pillow.
It's 2:30 AM.
It's okay.
There's still over 8 hours until the alarm goes off.
Chihiro: "Lie on your back."
Shota: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "..."
I lower his pajamas along with his underwear.
Incredibly naturally, I gently take his lovely penis in my mouth.
Squelch.
Shota: "W-Wait..."
Chihiro: "Don't move."
Shota: "But..."
Chihiro: "I'll do this until you feel sleepy."
Shota: "Eh..."
All senseless shame disappears.
All that remains is my sincere feelings for him.
Surely his mind will wander away from tomorrow while being caressed.
I want to let him rest, at least in his mind.
Of course, it's okay if he ejaculates.
On the contrary, that would probably help him sleep better.
A pleasant sense of relaxation should invite sleep.
Chihiro: "Mmm... Gulp... Mmm..."
I suck up what I held in my mouth.
Then I lick it all around with my tongue.
After all, I have to gently loosen his strung-out nerves.
Shota: "Ugh..."
A cute groan.
Shota is feeling what I'm doing.
His penis also gradually gets bigger.
It's gotten so hard that I can rub it with my lips.
Chihiro: "Hmm... Smack... Slurp... Mmm... Mmm..."
Shota: "Chi... Chihiro..."
Chihiro: "Mmm... Gulp... Mmm... Mmm... Mmm... Haah... Mmm... Mmm..."
Shota: "Wh... what's gotten into you?"
Chihiro: "..."
It's no wonder that Shota is surprised.
I want to ask myself the same question.
The strangeness that was hidden behind the veil of shame.
I should've done this every time we made love.
Not just fondling his penis.
There must be as many things he would enjoy as there are stars in the sky.
For example, being on top of Shota.
Or moving my hips on my own.
Or letting out more erotic sounds.
Or swallowing when he can't come inside...
Chihiro: "Mmm... Huh..."
Oh no.
The inside of my navel is throbbing tightly.
I can also feel my nipples hardening inside my bra.
I'm becoming more and more lascivious.
Chihiro: "Mmm... Hmm..."
I want to have sex.
But I can't beg for that much, of course.
The too kind Shota.
Since knowing about my pregnancy, his behavior has been almost saintly.
He would kiss me but not lay a finger on my body.
He prioritizes consideration over anything else.
Chihiro: "Ha... gulp... slurp... slurp... Mmm... Mmm..."
Shota: "Ugh... hi..."
Chihiro: "Haah... Haah... Gulp... Mmm... Mmm... Mmm... Gulp... Mmm..."
Shota: "Uh... Kuh... Ha... Ah..."
Chihiro: "Does... does it feel good?"
Shota: "Yeah, it does."
Chihiro: "Mmm... Hmm..."
That's not it.
He's not supposed to nod.
Chihiro: "He... hey..."
Shota: "Huff... Huff... wh... what...?"
Chihiro: "I... I'm terrible at this, aren't I?"
Shota: "No, you're not."
Chihiro: "Mmm..."
Please.
Say I'm terrible.
Say I'm a woman who's no good no matter what you do.
Don't hesitate.
Crunch.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Oh no.
The moment I looked up at his face.
I inadvertently put strength into my mouth.
Chihiro: "I... I'm sorry."
Shota: "..."
Chihiro: "Chew... Mmm..."
He ignored me.
Shota is angry.
I didn't mean to do it, but maybe this time he'll tell me.
About how bad Chihiro is.
Chihiro: "Sh... Shota?"
Shota: "..."
Chihiro: "Are you angry?"
Shota: "..."
Chihiro: "If you're angry, you can blame me."
Shota: "Snore... Snore..."
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Shota: "Snore... Snore... Zzz... Zzz..."
Chihiro: "..."
He fell asleep.
Chihiro: "Mmm..."
Slurp...
I let the deflated penis out of my mouth.
Gently returning his trousers back to their original position so as not to wake him.
That's it.
There's nothing else I can do.
It's my fault for thinking it's half-hearted.
While gazing at his face as he lies on his back.
I wrap myself in a towel blanket as if hugging my own chest.
Chihiro: "Ah... Uh..."
My lower abdomen was trembling.
Small, shivering tremors.
I squeeze my thighs tightly together.
Even if I concentrate my strength there, it won't stop.
My feelings remain restless.
I still want to be scolded.
But I'll be patient.
There's nothing I can do on my own.
I hold my chest tighter than before.
I forcibly close my eyelids.
All I can hear is Shota's snoring.
I should be relieved, but...
For some reason, I can't calm my unsettled feelings...

Teacher: "Chihiro-chan."
Chihiro: "Y... Yes?"
Teacher: "It's about time to start wearing a bra."
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Teacher: "Even if it's just for gym class."
Chihiro: "B... But everyone else, not yet..."
Teacher: "We received a note from the parents who watched the sports festival. Once you've reached a certain size, it's better for the school to guide you."
Chihiro: "..."
Teacher: "Go home and discuss it with your mother."
Chihiro: "I... I understand..."
