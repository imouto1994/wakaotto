...Two days later...
Chihiro: "Phew..."
Done.
Three posters that seem to attract families are completed.
I'm quite satisfied with the colorful hues.
"Happiness Hill City Office, Finance Bureau's pride of taste"
"Delicious yakisoba 280 yen (tax included)"
"Eat yakisoba and increase the greenery of the town"
"All proceeds will be donated to the local community's cherry blossom fund"
Chihiro: "..."
I reconfirm the materials I received.
It's fine.
The price isn't wrong.
I've included all the copy we came up with together.
As told, I made the characters for "Finance Bureau's pride" larger.
This was a request from Shou.
Apparently, there's another yakisoba stall within the same office.
I don't know why that is.
I think that's probably not unrelated to Shou's enthusiasm.
Chihiro: "Haah..."
The two days passed in the blink of an eye.
Yesterday started with shopping for drawing paper and markers.
On the way back, I exchanged money at the bank for change.
Just that took half a day.
Thanks to that, I had to take a break from my cooking class.
And today, I've been making posters since morning.
In between, I ironed Shou's yukata.
I attached an armband with the name of the city office to the sleeve so I wouldn't forget.
I also put an apron in the bag just in case.
"Stall staff should only wear yukatas"
That's what's written on the paper, but I thought it would probably be okay.
Chihiro: "..."
It's past 8 PM.
Shou called to say he was coming home about 30 minutes ago.
What kind of face will he make when he sees this poster?
I smile innocently for the first time in a while.
In a way, it was good.
I was busy enough to distract myself from my irritation.
Because my strange sense of impatience is only growing.
But while I'm focused on my work, I can somehow keep my composure.
It feels like I'm fighting with myself.
I still can't find a reason why it turned out like this.
Ding-dong.
Chihiro: "Y-yes?"
He's back.
It's Shou.
Chihiro: "W-wait, I'll open it right away."
Yusaku: "Good evening, ma'am."
Chihiro: "!!"
Yusaku: "Sorry for the sudden visit."
Chihiro: "Why are you..."
I started to say that and swallowed my words.
Shou's figure is behind him.
My heart is pounding as I almost dug my own grave.
Chihiro: "W...welcome."
Yusaku: "I appreciate all the help with the pool incident."
Chihiro: "N-no, the pleasure was mine."
Yusaku: "Did you manage the sunburn okay?"
Chihiro: "T-thanks to you, somehow... Please come in."
Yusaku: "...Then I'll do so without reservation."
Shota: "I'm home."
Chihiro: "...Welcome back."
Shota: "Can I have a brief meeting with the section chief about tomorrow... Is that okay?"
Chihiro: "Y-yes."
Chihiro: "..."
As expected.
His act of being a good person the day before yesterday was just a whim.
He wouldn't give up that easily.
Due to my nervousness, my strange sense of impatience suddenly disappears.
My mind is filled with thoughts of this devil.
Chihiro: "..."
As we pass by, he doesn't touch my buttocks.
But I mustn't let my guard down.
I will definitely resist if he does something.
I won't open my legs for him anymore.
Even if Shota is next to me, I'll glare at him as if he's dirt.
....
Yusaku: "...That's the plan."
Shota: "Understood."
Yusaku: "The ingredients will arrive at 3 PM. There's about an hour before the fair starts, but it's in a cooler box, so no need to worry."
Shota: "T-thank you for everything."
Yusaku: "This is the phone number of the supplier. We've secured 300 servings of fresh noodles."
Yusaku: "Of course, the first delivery will be half, 150, and after that, you can add more as needed. The place is in the next town, so it should take about 10 minutes to get there."
Shota: "If we sell out, we're sure to be number one."
Yusaku: "...Right."
Shota: "Is the change ready?"
Chihiro: "..."
Shota: "...Chihiro?"
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Shota: "Did you exchange money at the bank?"
Chihiro: "Y-yes."
Shota: "With that, our preparations are perfect."
Yusaku: "Hey..."
Looking forward to tomorrow?
You're lucky to have such a capable wife.
Yusaku: "Looking forward to tomorrow?"
Shota: "If we're doing it, we'll give it our all."
Yusaku: "...That's a good attitude."
Yusaku: "You're lucky to have such a capable wife."
Shota: "Without her, I wouldn't be who I am today."
Yusaku: "...You're boasting, huh."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "But I don't think preparations are complete yet."
Shota: "Don't worry, I've got it under control."
Yusaku: "...As expected from the section chief."
Shota: "It's about the yakisoba seasoning, right?"
Yusaku: "Aim for a flavor that's neither too strong nor too weak, something that everyone will like."
Shota: "Leave that to me. I've got a strong ally by my side."
Chihiro: "M-Me?"
Yusaku: "I see..."
Looks at his wife without saying anything
She's good at cooking too
*Stare*...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "Your wife is quite the cook."
Shota: "Do you think so too, Chief?"
Yusaku: "She's too good for you."
Shota: "I'm honored to receive such high praise."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Shota: "Chihiro, you've prepared the yakisoba noodles, right?"
Chihiro: "Yes, I have prepared ten portions of noodles... and several types of sauces..."
Shota: "As expected of my wife. I can really rely on you."
Yusaku: "..."
Looks at his wife without saying anything
She might be more useful than her husband if put to work
*Stare*...
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Shota: "Chihiro might be well-suited to be a secretary."
Yusaku: "She's not only quick-thinking but also a beauty, right?"
Yusaku: "She might be more useful than her husband if put to work."
Shota: "That's a harsh joke..."
Yusaku: "Capable people always plan ahead."
Shota: "Well, that's true, but..."
Yusaku: "She's not only quick-thinking but also a beauty."
Shota: "I wholeheartedly agree with that."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "Your wife really does have the looks of a model."
Shota: "Actually, there's a rumor that she has some secret fans in this apartment complex..."
Yusaku: "I wholeheartedly agree with that."
Chihiro: "Please stop it already!!"
Shota: "Hey, hey."
Yusaku: "..."
Chihiro: "..."
I stood up, shaking the chair.
I couldn't stand it anymore.
What's with his pretentious good guy act?
I don't want to hear your compliments.
You're just saying things you don't even mean.
I'd rather have you spread my legs than this.
I went straight to the kitchen.
I'm losing control more than I thought.
Chihiro: "Haah...haah..."
I took a few deep breaths in front of the sink.
I need to calm down.
Why am I so angry?
If I think about it calmly, it was a trivial conversation.
A common sight when inviting a boss to the house.
Yet I got so excited and raised my voice, completely losing my manners.
My anger cooled down...
It's as if the tide was receding.
My cheeks also gradually paled.
Chihiro: "(What... what should I do...)"
It's too late to regret now.
I feel so guilty that I can't back down.
Yusaku: "...Ma'am."
Chihiro: "Y-Yes?"
I heard his voice over my shoulder.
I was too scared to look back.
Yusaku: "If I've upset you, please forgive me. We've finished our meeting, and it'd be awkward to stay too long..."
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Is he leaving?
Really?
Yusaku: "Well then... hang in there."
Shota: "Um, I'm... sorry for... whatever this is..."
Yusaku: "...It was wrong of me to say unnecessary things."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Am I dreaming?
That devil apologized.
The sound of the door opening and closing from the entrance.
That must be a hallucination.
He's the most persistent man in the world.
There's no way he'd leave without causing some trouble.
Shota: "What... what just happened?"
Chihiro: "..."
Chihiro: "...Did he leave?"
Shota: "Y-Yeah."
Chihiro: "Really?"
Shota: "You've been strange. Suddenly getting angry, not saying goodbye..."
Chihiro: "..."
This must be a dream.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Oh no...
I forgot about the key.
He must know it wasn't in the mailbox.
He could have said something when he was leaving.
I have to return it.
I don't want to keep it anymore.
Chihiro: "I-I'll go apologize to Mr. Section Chief."
Shota: "W-Wait."
I grabbed my hat from the chest.
Leaving Shota, who was in shock, I hurriedly chased after the devil.
Click... Bang.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
The elevator was just lit up on the second floor.
I can catch up.
I definitely can.
I let my skirt flutter.
Running down the stairs skipping a step.
I don't care who I pass by.
Nor do I care about the shaking of my chest.
Chihiro: "Haah... Haah... Haah..."
Yusaku: "Well, well?"
Chihiro: "Ah...!"
Almost at the same time.
I might have been a little faster.
Yusaku: "What's the matter, ma'am?"
Chihiro: "What's the matter...?"
Without even a moment to catch my breath, I opened the cap of the hat.
I handed the key I had kept to the devil.
Yusaku: "...You could have left it in the mailbox."
Chihiro: "I-I don't want you to complain later."
Yusaku: "I see."
The devil nodded as if he understood.
He took the key without touching my fingers.
Yusaku: "Thank you for going to the trouble."
Chihiro: "Can you stop talking in that creepy way?"
Yusaku: "Then, I'll leave the seasoning of the yakisoba to you."
Chihiro: "Don't change the subject."
Yusaku: "Anyway, I'm glad you didn't fall."
Chihiro: "That's why I..."
Yusaku: "You should get back soon or your husband will worry."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
The conversation doesn't match.
His attitude is deliberate.
He remains calm as if nothing happened.
And for some reason, I'm the only one who's desperate.
I just can't accept that.
Yusaku: "...Right."
Chihiro: "!!"
Suddenly he grabs my arm.
Chihiro: "Hey..."
Yusaku: "It's a bit awkward here."
Chihiro: "..."
Here it comes.
He finally showed his true colors.
It was expected that he'd chase me over the key issue.
So I pretended to forget it on purpose.
It's just like something this guy would think of.
But this time, it won't go like always.
If he tries anything funny, I'll scream.
I won't let him touch me anymore.
Except for the wrist he's holding to pull me.
Yusaku: "...It's okay here."
Chihiro: "If you do anything strange, I'll scream."
Yusaku: "I suddenly remembered that I still owed you one thing."
Chihiro: "...Huh?"
Yusaku: "The promise to let you slap me."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "Go ahead and give it your all."
Chihiro: "So you think you can just reset everything with that."
Yusaku: "Please slap me until you're satisfied."
Chihiro: "..."
I finally understand.
The reason for my inexplicable irritation.
It's all because of this man's irresponsibility.
He messes me up.
And then he alone acts as if he can rewind back to the past.
Despite the fact that he's the one who pushed me into the abyss.
Turn it back.
Turn me back to before I was involved with you.
Chihiro: "I... I won't slap you."
Yusaku: "You'll definitely feel better."
Chihiro: "I... I won't feel better."
Yusaku: "Why not give it a try?"
Chihiro: "Stop using that language!!"
Something exploded inside me.
My feelings are in an unbelievable turmoil.
Tears are overflowing like a waterfall.
My panic is incomparable to earlier.
In the end, I forget that I'm outside.
I start to cry out loud.
I don't care if someone comes.
I don't care if the light in the window comes on.
I'm just crying like a child.
And before I know it, I'm alone.
The devil was gone before I knew it.
Chihiro: "Eh... Eh...?"
He left me alone again.
This is terrible.
Despite it all being your fault.
You pretend not to know and just go home.
Of course, I don't want to be comforted.
I'm just...
Chihiro: "..."
Just...?
What exactly?
What do I want?
I should feel relieved that he's gone.
Yet, I'm still furiously angry.
Nothing makes sense.
It even astounds me.
Chihiro: "*sniff*..."
That's enough.
I will never think about that man again.
Chihiro: "Hah..."
Unlike when I chased him, my feet feel as heavy as lead.
I stop in front of the entrance.
I press my fingertips hard against my swollen eyelids.
I want to erase the traces of my tears.
All I can think about now is the immediate future.
Shota: "Ch-Chihiro."
Chihiro: "!?"
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Shota: "..."
Chihiro: "What's the matter?"
Shota: "That's my line."
Chihiro: "..."
He called out to me from behind.
So he came from the direction of the road.
Chihiro: "Did... Did you come looking for me?"
Shota: "I was worried because you were late."
Chihiro: "I'm... sorry..."
Not only my gaze, but my entire face is cast downwards.
I desperately try to conceal my bloodshot eyes.
Shota: "I thought something might have happened."
Chihiro: "Ah, I was just walking him to the station to apologize..."
Shota: "...I see."
Chihiro: "*sob*..."
Liar.
Shota: "Rather, the section chief must have been surprised, right?"
Chihiro: "...Huh?"
Shota: "That you chased after him."
Chihiro: "Y-Yes... well..."
Shota: "Did he forgive you?"
Chihiro: "He... He said not to worry about it."
Shota: "Oh, good."
Chihiro: "*sniff*..."
I can't take it anymore.
I can't bear this.
I'm just a burden to Shota.
Tears are flowing like a waterfall from my eyes again.
My shoulders are shaking with my intense sobs.
Shota: "Wh-What's wrong?"
Chihiro: "*hic*..."
I cling to Shota.
Shota: "Did... did the section chief say something?"
Chihiro: "*sniff*... No..."
Shota: "Th-Then..."
Chihiro: "I... I don't want to live here... I want to go back to the countryside..."
Shota: "Whaaat?"
Chihiro: "*sniff*... *hic*... *sob*..."
He naturally asked for a reason.
But I couldn't answer anything.
It's not because I was crying.
It's just that I couldn't tell him what I did.
If the result is the same, then the memories remain beautiful.
If I were just a selfish woman, I could still save my feelings.
Chihiro: "*hic*... *sob*..."
I bit my lip tightly.
Shota's scent.
This might be the last time.
The tears flowing down my cheek moistened my palm.
Like loosening a ring, the tears infiltrated the gaps...
...
...
...
I feel like crying again.
I feel sorry for Shota.
Shota: "Then, shall we go back to the room and start?"
Chihiro: "Start... what?"
Shota: "Practicing making yakisoba."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
This isn't good.
It wasn't the time to be crying.
Chihiro: "What... what time is it?"
Shota: "It's exactly 10 o'clock now."
Chihiro: "We have to hurry, or we'll go to bed late."
Yusaku: "The festival doesn't start until the evening, so it's okay."
Even though he said that, he urged me.
We both hurriedly went to the entrance.
Even at a time like this, he doesn't go ahead by himself.
He properly adjusts to my pace.
Kind Shota.
He would never leave me alone.
He's so different from that devil.
Chihiro: "..."
But...
Am I really a woman worth this much consideration?
If it were real, he would get on the elevator first.
Looking back at me with cold eyes.
"A useless woman should use the stairs."
That might be more appropriate.
If it's Shota, I would understand.
I would climb the lonely stairs.
To the elevator on the third floor where he is waiting.
But there was no one there.
He's not waiting for me.
I'm disappointed as I press the doorbell.
But there's no answer.
Probably a punishment for being slow to climb.
Until Shota's mood improves.
I have no choice but to stand outside...
...
...
