...The next day, 1 p.m...
AV Actress: "Ahaaa... Hmm..."
Yuusaku: "Tch..."
Damn it.
Why do they have to use fake breasts?
No matter how much they try to disguise it, it's obvious.
The male actor's consideration is all too apparent.
Despite it being a rape scene, he doesn't squeeze them hard.
Pop.
Yuusaku: "...Damn it."
Breasts that don't ripple no matter what is done to them.
That's why I hate the fake ones.
Thanks to that, all I can do is lose interest.
My flaccid member is about to droop and fall off.
Ding-dong.
Yuusaku: "..."
It's precisely 1 p.m.
The intercom shows that stupid face I was expecting.
Welcome.
To my home, where I never forget to stock up on tissues.
Click...
Shouta: "Sorry for the delay."
Yuusaku: "You're not really late."
Shouta: "Ah, yes."
Yuusaku: "The time is exactly 1 p.m. as promised. As expected from the hope of the budget department, huh?"
Shouta: "I, I'm flattered."
Yuusaku: "Well, since you're here, make yourself comfortable."
Shouta: "Eh?"
Yuusaku: "You were interested in my room, weren't you?"
Shouta: "Eh...?"
Yuusaku: "When I mooched off your food at your place, you said you wanted to see it, didn't you?"
Shouta: "Now that you mention it... I think I did..."
Yuusaku: "Heheh..."
"Were you called over for just that reason?"
His face seems to say exactly that.
It's a precious day off, after all.
I understand wanting to spend it with your wife.
Especially as you're such a loving husband.
But you can rest easy.
Although it's slightly warped, it's exactly as you think.
Yuusaku: "Just sit down."
Shouta: "Y-yes."
Akizuki is scurrying around.
He looks around restlessly.
Shouta: "Um, the window is..."
Yuusaku: "I'll melt if I'm exposed to the sun."
Shouta: "Eh...?"
That's hilarious.
Shouta: "You, you keep it quite clean."
Yuusaku: "...Are you being sarcastic?"
Shouta: "No, not at all."
Yuusaku: "Well, I tidied up a bit thinking you were coming."
Shouta: "I'm sorry for causing you trouble."
Yuusaku: "It's fine... here, have some tea."
Shouta: "I-I'll take it."
Slurp, slurp, slurp, slurp, slurp, slurp...
Yuusaku: "How's work?"
Shouta: "...I'm doing my best in my own way."
Yuusaku: "..."
Has anything changed since you got the role?
The deputy chief was praising you again
Your wife's got a big chest, hasn't she?
How many times a week do you have sex?
You seem like you could make it in any company
Are your parents still in good health?
Yuusaku: "Has anything changed since you got the position?"
Shouta: "Well, quite a lot."
Yuusaku: "You mean that in a good way, right?"
Shouta: "Of course. I'm really grateful to you, Chief."
Yuusaku: "You earned it through your own efforts. Just keep aiming higher."
Shouta: "Yes, sir."
Yuusaku: "You always respond perfectly."
Yuusaku: "The deputy chief was praising you again."
Shouta: "Really?"
Yuusaku: "There's no point in lying about something like that."
Shouta: "I'll work hard to live up to expectations."
Yuusaku: "...That's a good attitude."
Yuusaku: "Your wife's got a big chest, hasn't she?"
Shouta: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "It's big, right?"
Shouta: "..."
Yuusaku: "How big is it?"
Shouta: "I don't think that's a...appropriate topic..."
Yuusaku: "We're two guys, it's fine."
Shouta: "Well, as a husband, I don't think it's something to discuss with others..."
Shouta: "So, again, I'd rather not talk about that..."
Yuusaku: "Ah, I see."
Shouta: "Sorry."
Yuusaku: "...I don't mind."
Yuusaku: "How many times a week do you have sex?"
Shouta: "Wha?"
Yuusaku: "I'm asking about the frequency of your marital relations."
Shouta: "I'd rather not discuss that..."
Yuusaku: "Don't tell me you're neglecting your wife because of work."
Shouta: "No, that's not..."
Yuusaku: "I'm concerned as your boss."
Shouta: "But..."
Shouta: "So, again, I'd rather not talk about that..."
Yuusaku: "You're not too old to be embarrassed."
Shouta: "Sorry..."
Yuusaku: "If things are going well, you don't need to answer. It means I can ask you for work without hesitation."
Yuusaku: "You seem like you could make it in any company."
Shouta: "What?!"
Shouta: "Wa-wait a minute."
Yuusaku: "...What's the matter all of a sudden?"
Shouta: "What do you mean by that?"
Yuusaku: "It's just a compliment."
Shouta: "...A compliment?"
Yuusaku: "It means you've become strong."
Shouta: "I see..."
Yuusaku: "Sit down, will you."
Shouta: "I, I thought I might be fired for a moment."
Yuusaku: "You've just become a section manager, that's not going to happen."
Shouta: "W, well, when you put it that way, sure."
Yuusaku: "Do you like your current job that much?"
Shouta: "Yes."
Yuusaku: "Why is that?"
Shouta: "I hate to say it myself, but I think being a civil servant suits me. Plus, I managed to get the job after overcoming many hurdles..."
Yuusaku: "I see..."
Yuusaku: "Your parents are alive and well, aren't they?"
Shouta: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "I'm talking about your parents."
Shouta: "Y, yes, they're doing okay, thankfully."
Yuusaku: "How about your wife's parents?"
Shouta: "Yes, well..."
Yuusaku: "...You seem hesitant."
Shouta: "I, I only see them about once a year."
Yuusaku: "You need to maintain good relationships."
Shouta: "It's a bit difficult in my case."
Yuusaku: "Difficult?"
Shouta: "I'm still the hated man who took away their precious daughter."
Yuusaku: "Even though you and your wife were childhood friends?"
Shouta: "If it had ended there, nothing would have happened. But I essentially ruined their dreams by forcing them into marriage."
Yuusaku: "Then you need to make your wife happy."
Shouta: "R, right. If Chihiro is unhappy, I'll get punched. Not just by my father-in-law, but by my mother-in-law too."
Yuusaku: "...You certainly have your hardships."
Shouta: "...Um."
Yuusaku: "What is it?"
Shouta: "I've seen your room, and I don't want to overstay my welcome. If you have nothing else for me, I think I should be going soon..."
Yuusaku: "You've only just arrived."
Shouta: "Y, yes... but..."
Yuusaku: "Do you have other plans?"
Shouta: "...Not plans as such, but I need to do some shopping..."
Yuusaku: "Well, if that's the case, I won't hold you back."
Shouta: "I'm sorry."
Yuusaku: "Say goodbye before you leave."
Shouta: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "To my wife."
Shouta: "What!?"
Yuusaku: "You don't need to be that surprised."
Shouta: "Y, you're married!?"
Yuusaku: "Haha..."
Shouta: "B, but I thought you said you were single earlier..."
Yuusaku: "...Come this way."
Shouta: "W, where to?"
Yuusaku: "My wife is in the closet."
Shouta: "Please, don't tease me like this."
Yuusaku: "Whether it's a joke or not, you can decide by looking for yourself."
I opened the door and beckoned him.
Hurry up.
The reason I called you is for this.
Shouta: "Uh..."
He nervously came to my side.
He was prepared to run at any moment and peered into the dark closet.
Shouta: "There's... no one in there."
Yuusaku: "Yes, there is, right there."
Shouta: "??"
Yuusaku: "That thing in the corner."
Shouta: "...A cardboard box?"
Yuusaku: "That's my wife."
Shouta: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "This is a secret I'm only telling you. Don't tell anyone else."
Shouta: "I...I don't even know what to say..."
Yuusaku: "Try removing the towel draped over it."
Shouta: "Please, don't scare me. I'm not good with things like this."
Yuusaku: "Just do it already."
Shouta: "O-okay."
What a scaredy-cat.
Still, he couldn't defy me and reached out nervously to the towel.
Shouta: "It's... it's kind of damp..."
Yuusaku: "If I don't keep it moist, it dries out quickly."
He peeled off the towel.
Shouta: "Ugh..."
Yuusaku: "What do you think?"
Shouta: "What... what is this?"
Yuusaku: "As you can see, it's a vagina."
Shouta: "A...a...a vagina?"
Yuusaku: "It's well-made, don't you think?"
Shouta: "..."
Shouta: "...Is it a fake?"
Yuusaku: "This is what they call a RealDoll."
Shouta: "Ah..."
He smacked his hand in recognition like an idiot.
Shouta: "I've seen these on TV before. They're made to look exactly like humans, and they cost over a million yen, if I remember correctly..."
It's secondhand, secondhand
It's worth a lot of money
Yuusaku: "It's secondhand, secondhand."
Shouta: "What!?"
Yuusaku: "That's why there's no need to be so surprised."
Shouta: "But if it's been used by someone else, I feel a bit..."
Yuusaku: "I got it for free, so I can't complain."
Shouta: "You... got it for free?"
Yuusaku: "Yeah."
Shouta: "Did the person who gave it to you have trouble getting rid of it?"
Yuusaku: "Maybe."
Shouta: "You sure have a lot of interesting connections, Chief."
Yuusaku: "Well, I guess."
Yuusaku: "It has its own value, after all."
Shouta: "...I guess so."
Yuusaku: "Why don't you buy one for yourself?"
Shouta: "Uh... I'll pass."
Yuusaku: "You don't want a pussy like this?"
Shouta: "Chihiro would scold me."
Yuusaku: "I see..."
*Grip*
Shouta: "Ugh..."
I push one side of the soft flesh with my finger.
I split open the steamy valley covered by the towel.
Yuusaku: "How about it?"
Shouta: "It's... uncannily like the real thing."
Yuusaku: "Right?"
How is the shape of the slit?
How is the color and luster of the labia?
How big is the vagina?
You want to put it in too, right?
Yuusaku: "How is the shape of the slit?"
Shouta: "It's... amazing how it's not just straight."
Yuusaku: "... You have quite sharp observations."
Shouta: "Th-thank you."
Yuusaku: "How is the color and luster of the labia?"
Shouta: "I think the quality is indistinguishable from the real thing."
Yuusaku: "Being complimented by you, it must be satisfied."
Shouta: "I'm... flattered."
Yuusaku: "How big is the vagina?"
Shouta: "The entrance seems incredibly small."
Yuusaku: "The inside might be deceptively loose."
Shouta: "Haven't you used it yet?"
Yuusaku: "If you give me permission."
Shouta: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "Nod if I can use it."
Shouta: "No, I mean... it's your property... please, feel free to... "
Yuusaku: "You want to put it in too, don't you?"
Shouta: "Eh?"
Yuusaku: "Be honest."
Shouta: "No, I... "
Yuusaku: "You don't want a pussy like this?"
Shouta: "Uh... "
Yuusaku: "If not for your indecisiveness, you'd be a chief in no time."
Shouta: "No, I don't want it!"
Yuusaku: "What don't you want?"
Shouta: "I don't want a pussy like this."
Yuusaku: "So, you don't want to put it in?"
Shouta: "I absolutely don't want to put it in."
Yuusaku: "Touching it feels dirty?"
Shouta: "Looking is enough, I guess."
Yuusaku: "Liar."
Shouta: "No, I'm not lying."
Yuusaku: "Make your decision after observing it more closely."
Shouta: "I've seen enough already."
Yuusaku: "Thorough examination is the motto of the budget division."
Shouta: "Well... I guess..."
Yuusaku: "Pay attention to the pubic hair around the hole. Even the bumps at the base are reproduced."
Shouta: "U-uh... It's really..."
Yuusaku: "It's too real to show in public."
Shouta: "Certainly, this is too extreme."
Yuusaku: "..."
Don't hesitate.
Get your face closer.
Close enough that your breath huffs and puffs.
Shouta: "But why is there a hole in this part?"
Yuusaku: "Apparently, mold grows easily here. So, to keep the air circulation and not to let it dry out... The maintenance must be quite difficult, right?"
Shouta: "Y-yeah, I suppose."
Yuusaku: "If you think I'm lying, smell it."
Shouta: "S-smell?"
Yuusaku: "It already smells like mold."
Shouta: "N-no, I didn't say you were lying..."
Yuusaku: "The deputy director always says that experience is important, right?"
Shouta: "Does this also count as that kind of experience?"
Yuusaku: "If you limit it to work, you'll become narrow-minded."
Shouta: "Ugh..."
Yuusaku: "Here you go."
Shouta: "O-okay, I understand. *sniff sniff*."
Yuusaku: "You won't get it unless you get closer."
Shouta: "*sniff sniff*... *sniff sniff*..."
Oh, oh no, Section Chief!!
Yuusaku: "Heh heh..."
Shouta: "It's not fair to push my head!"
Yuusaku: "Don't make such a disgusted face. No matter what, it's pitiful for Chii-chan."
Shouta: "Ch-Chii-chan?"
Yuusaku: "A name I just came up with."
Shouta: "I didn't know you had such a hobby..."
Yuusaku: "That's why I said it was a secret."
Shouta: "I... see..."
But more importantly, Section Chief...
The fool who frowned at me...
He was still rubbing his nose, which was still attached to the pussy, with the back of his hand.
Yuusaku: "What?"
Shouta: "I thought I heard a strange voice earlier..."
Yuusaku: "From where?"
Shouta: "Where... from this box."
Yuusaku: "When?"
Shouta: "When... when I put my nose against it..."
Yuusaku: "Hey hey hey hey, wait."
Shouta: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "Unlike you, I live alone."
Shouta: "I-I know."
Yuusaku: "What will you do if I can't sleep?"
Shouta: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "I'm not good with occult-like stories..."
Thump.
Chihiro: "!!"
Shouta: "You can't kick it!"
Yuusaku: "Sleeping soundly at night is more important, you know."
Thud.
Chihiro: "!!"
It hurts.
It really hurts.
Yuusaku: "You try it too."
Shouta: "No, I can't..."
Yuusaku: "You're the one who said something strange."
Shouta: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "Come on."
Shouta: "Alright, I understand."
Plop.
Yuusaku: "...Why are you holding back?"
Shouta: "If I kick it hard, it might break..."
Yuusaku: "I don't care."
Shouta: "But that's too pitiful, isn't it?"
Yuusaku: "What is?"
Shouta: "It's... because of Chi-chan."
Yuusaku: "When you feel like that, just gently stroke the pussy... here."
Shouta: "Wait... Section Chief..."
Chihiro: "(Ugh...)"
Who's touching it?
Shouta?
Or is it Section Chief?
Either way, stop it.
Please don't touch it.
I might make a strange noise this time.
Shouta: "I must have heard it wrong."
Yuusaku: "Really?"
Shouta: "It was probably the sound of the cardboard creaking."
Yuusaku: "...Well, that's fine then."
Nupu...
Chihiro: "(Gasp...)"
Shouta: "I should really get going now..."
Yuusaku: "Don't be so frantic about wiping your finger."
Shouta: "But it's sticky..."
Yuusaku: "Probably because I put a steamed towel on it."
Shouta: "I understand, please excuse me now."
Yuusaku: "Then, here's a special present for you."
Shouta: "Is there something else?"
Yuusaku: "...I've submitted a leave request for you."
Shouta: "Huh?"
Yuusaku: "The day after tomorrow, you'll be with me for pool-side entertaining."
Shouta: "P-Pool?"
Yuusaku: "The client we're entertaining has a family, so I can't hold the fort alone. It's not a negative thing for you..."
...
Chihiro: "...?"
The fading voices.
They must have closed the closet door.
The light coming through the gap also vanished completely.
Total darkness.
Relief and fear arrive together.
I hate the dark.
I also hate being confined.
But it can't be helped.
It's better than having Shouta see that picture.
I, who responded to the call with a shrinking feeling.
But that was only until I stepped foot in the room.
Wall to wall.
Pictures of women with their legs spread were pasted up.
The place was a familiar infirmary.
In other words, that obscene woman was me.
The devil grinned at me.
He pointed at a large cardboard box and said Shouta would come in an hour.
Needless to say, I turned pale.
I had to desperately peel off and throw away the pictures.
And the moment I tore off the last one.
I was thrown into the cardboard box without warning.
My body sank into the pile of my discarded paper.
My butt stuck in the box, I couldn't move anymore.
My belt was unbuckled just like that.
Without being able to resist, my jeans and underwear were pulled off together.
Needless to say what happened next.
The lid was closed.
I had no choice but to tremble in the darkness.
Yes.
I was prepared for a worse situation than I had imagined.
And that preparation became reality.
When I heard Shouta's voice, I felt like my heart would jump out of my mouth.
One wrong step and everything would be over.
I managed to endure it, even though I was scared of the risk.
It was really hard.
Especially Shouta's words.
It was shocking that he mentioned such erotic things.
That might have been the devil's goal.
The intention to ruin our relationship.
That hasn't changed from the beginning.
Chihiro: "..."
How long should I stay like this?
Has Shouta already left?
Or is he still plotting something?
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
My body hurts.
Probably because I've been in the same position for so long.
But the cardboard box is so cramped it feels like it's swelling.
Unless someone reaches out to me, I can't even change the direction of my body.
I close my eyes with a deep sigh.
I don't like the darkness with my eyes open.
I was doing the same before I heard Shouta's voice.
Please open it quickly.
Let me out of here.
I can't take it anymore.
I'm just like I was back then.
The never-fading memories of my childhood.
They start to bubble up again.
I wonder how old I was then.
It was one of my summer vacations.
I was sent to my aunt's house to play alone.
My parents owned several beauty salons in town.
So they were always busy and didn't have time for a child.
I don't know if they felt sorry for me.
Anyway, I ended up spending half of my summer vacation at my aunt's house.
A rural town surrounded by mountains.
Well water that was so cold it could freeze your hands, even in summer.
The smell of mosquito coils permeating the walls.
Chickens making noise from early morning.
My kind uncle and aunt.
They loved me so much because they had no children.
But it was a few days after I started staying there.
Late at night.
After eating a full belly of watermelon, I went to the bathroom because I couldn't sleep.
I don't remember the exact time.
All I remember is the image of me, timidly walking down the dimly lit hallway.
I naturally tip-toed, not even wanting to hear the creaking sound of the wooden boards.
Straight ahead was the bathroom door.
To the side was my uncle's room.
That's where I started hearing strange noises.
My aunt was groaning as if in pain.
I was scared and wanted to go back to my room.
But soon my concern grew stronger.
Maybe she wasn't feeling well.
Chihiro: "..."
But I didn't have the courage to open the sliding door.
Even as a child, I felt hesitant to do so.
Reluctantly, I crouched down.
I brought my eyes closer to the hole in the sliding door that I had noticed every time I passed by.
Chihiro: "!?"
Naked.
Swinging breasts.
My uncle was tormenting my aunt.
His usually gentle face was like a demon's.
Almost like a wrathful deity.
But my aunt wasn't like that.
Even though she seemed in pain, she was saying "more, more".
Her tone was fawning even though she was being tormented.
The weirdness made my legs tremble even more.
But the real fear started there.
He must have sensed something.
I made eye contact with my uncle.
I quickly looked away from the hole in the sliding door.
In the end, I didn't even go to the toilet.
I ran back to my room and wrapped myself in a blanket.
Chihiro: "Hii..."
I couldn't stop shaking.
I was scared, wondering when my uncle would come into my room.
And the next morning.
I wet the bed.
For the first time since I had been staying there, my uncle scolded me.
And that was after my aunt had gone out to work in the fields.
I was locked in a pitch-black barn.
I curled up in a gap between bales of hay for about an hour.
The slight light leaking from the gap in the sliding door.
I stared at it.
I'm scared.
Please let me out soon.
After a while, my uncle opened the door.
He had his usual kind face again.
"Don't tell anyone what you saw yesterday."
Even though he was smiling, his tone was scary.
For some reason, he had a camera in his hand.
I strangely don't remember what happened after that.
But I do remember one thing...
It's that I must never tell anyone.
*SFX*...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Once again, light came in through a gap in the cardboard box.
Followed by the sound of dragging.
My body sways irregularly in the confined space.
...
