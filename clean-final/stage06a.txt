...The same day, late at night...
Yusaku: "..."
Yusaku: "...heh."
Now then.
I wonder how it's going to turn out.
Probably hell on earth by now.
I casually operate the buttons on my mobile phone.
Leisurely re-reading the text I sent to Akizuki.
The ultimate provocation.
Impressive, really.
I might have some writing talent.
Your wife has turned into a lewd woman.
But I'm the victim here.
All the blame lies with that woman.
Now it's all about how Akizuki will take it.
Can you believe your wife 100%?
At least, the fact that she came here can't be erased.
And I'm your precious boss.
You don't want to lose the position you've worked so hard to get, right?
Knowing him, he might offer up his wife as an apology.
What should I do if that happens?
Just violating her wouldn't be interesting.
First, they should have sex in front of me.
How about watching their sex?
Ding-dong.
Yusaku: "..."
Who's it?
It's 1 a.m.
Some drunk who pressed the wrong button?
Yusaku: "...yes?"
Shota: "Sorry to bother you at this hour."
The figure on the intercom.
It's Akizuki.
What a surprise.
Yusaku: "Wait a moment."
Click...
Yusaku: "You're looking serious."
Shota: "..."
Yusaku: "Did you get my email?"
Shota: "Uh, Chief..."
Bang!!
Yusaku: "!?"
A sudden intense punch to the jaw.
My brain is rocked and I fall flat on my ass.
Yusaku: "What the hell..."
Shota: "Y-you're a terrible person."
Yusaku: "Huh?"
Shota: "I, I heard everything from Chihiro."
Yusaku: "..."
So what?
Was my genius provocation ineffective?
Damn it.
Can't be helped.
He's a guy who only looks straight ahead like a workhorse.
Shota: "I, I'm going to the police to file a complaint."
Yusaku: "I'll file it myself, don't worry."
Shota: "Huh?"
Yusaku: "You hit me, didn't you?"
Shota: "C-compared to what you did..."
Yusaku: "...do you have any proof?"
Shota: "Uh..."
Yusaku: "It was your wife who started flirting with me."
Shota: "H-how can you say such a thing?"
Yusaku: "Why do you only believe your wife's words?"
Shota: "She would never lie."
Yusaku: "So you're saying you can't believe my words."
Shota: "..."
Yusaku: "I've been looking after various things up until now, haven't I?"
Shota: "That doesn't matter right now."
Yusaku: "Calm down a bit."
Shota: "...I am calm."
Yusaku: "You're excited enough to punch me, aren't you?"
Shota: "May I punch you again?"
Yusaku: "Huh?"
Shota: "I don't think I'll be able to calm down unless I do that."
Yusaku: "..."
Come on.
Is he serious?
And here I am, still reeling.
Yusaku: "...You really love your wife, don't you?"
Saying that, I slowly stood up.
Akizuki is on guard.
But contrary to his expectation, I just bow my head deeply.
Shota: "What are you trying to do?"
Yusaku: "I'm sorry."
Shota: "..."
Yusaku: "I apologize as you see."
Shota: "You're admitting to the threat."
Yusaku: "I admit... I'm really sorry..."
Shota: "No matter how much you apologize, the wound in my heart won't heal."
Yusaku: "I understand."
I look completely defeated.
I have no choice but to give him a pleading look.
Yusaku: "Can't we settle this amicably?"
Shota: "That's not the problem."
Yusaku: "...I'll quit my job at the office to take responsibility."
Shota: "Huh?"
Yusaku: "I'll also kneel and apologize to your wife."
Tears welled up in my eyes.
Akizuki's figure also blurred.
I knelt down.
And rubbed my forehead on the floor.
You're a kind man, aren't you?
Please extend a helping hand to me...
...
Chihiro: "..."
Late at night on a weekday.
For some reason, I'm in a car.
I received a message on my phone a little after 1 a.m.
"We've decided to talk things over."
Of course, the message was from Shota.
I got dressed.
Went out to the street and caught a taxi.
The destination is the Chief's house.
It's likely to take about 30 minutes as the roads are empty.
...
A mansion quietly standing in a residential area.
There are no people around as usual.
It's eerily quiet.
Chihiro: "..."
Shivering?
But Shota is here today, so it's okay.
There's nothing to worry about.
We're just going to have an adult conversation.
The sound of a dog barking in the distance.
I shrugged my shoulders, went through the arch and straight to the elevator.
In the small space surrounded on all sides, I let out a sigh of relief.
Chihiro: "Phew..."
I'm glad I made the decision after all.
I was about to return to the room without picking up my sandals.
I bumped into Shota at the front door.
It seems he was going out to look for me.
Of course, the reason was the email from the Chief.
I saw it later, but for some reason, I was made out to be the villain.
He even sent a clear picture.
Shota was terribly upset.
So much so that I had to be the calm one.
First, I apologized to him.
Then I explained carefully so as not to be misunderstood.
That was right after.
His face turned red and he stormed out of the room.
I can't reach him on his phone.
I'm nervously pacing in the room.
So, when I got the email, I almost cried.
I was really worried.
Ching... whoosh...
Chihiro: "..."
The usually mild Shota.
Kind Shota, who also has a bit of a weak side.
Honestly, I was surprised.
I didn't think he would confront him directly.
A bold action he took for me.
While I feel loved, I feel guilty for causing him trouble.
I'm sorry.
I will be a better wife from now on.
I promise.
Ding dong.
Yusaku: "...Yes?"
Chihiro: "It's Chihiro."
Yusaku: "Sorry to bother you."
Chihiro: "...?"
A weak tone.
Who was that just now?
Click...
The door opens.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I was surprised at the sight of Chief who greeted me.
His eyes were bloodshot.
There was also blood seeping from the corners of his mouth.
Yusaku: "...Please come in."
Chihiro: "Y-yes."
I was invited in.
Chief Kazama, with his shoulders slumped.
He followed me like a servant.
Chihiro: "...Where is my husband?"
Yusaku: "He's waiting over there."
Chihiro: "...?"
The sound of the key locking behind me.
From the back of the room, I heard a chilling moan.
Chihiro: "Sh-Shota?"
Shota: "Uuuh!!"
Chihiro: "!?"
The color drained from my face.
The large refrigerator in the kitchen.
He was wrapped around it with duct tape.
And his lower abdomen was exposed.
Chihiro: "...!"
This is not the time to be startled.
I have to help Shota.
Yank.
Chihiro: "Ouch..."
Yusaku: "Don't panic."
The moment I tried to run to him.
My hair was pulled back hard from behind.
My body reeled back from the recoil.
I desperately reached out to support myself.
But the hand that supported my back belonged to the person I least wanted to touch.
I fell squarely into the unwanted arms.
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Goosebumps crawl over my skin.
I feel like throwing up.
Of course, I struggle with all my might.
Chihiro: "P-please let me go."
Yusaku: "I don't want to."
Chihiro: "..."
His previous feebleness seems like a lie.
He's back to his usual inconsiderate tone.
I was deceived.
Including being called here.
Shota's face, flushed a dark red.
Eyes full of despair.
They tell the story of the situation he's in.
Chihiro: "P-please let my husband go."
Yusaku: "Don't be selfish."
Chihiro: "W-why is Shota in such a state..."
Yusaku: "It's his fault for hitting me first."
Chihiro: "...Sh-Shota."
Yusaku: "I'm not lying."
Squeeze.
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Chief Kazama's hand on my chest.
I'm far beyond feeling nauseous.
I feel like I might faint, no exaggeration.
Yusaku: "He seems to be really upset about you."
Knead, squeeze...
Chihiro: "N-noooo!!"
Shota: "U-uuhhh!!"
Yusaku: "You have big breasts."
Chihiro: "Stop it, let me go!!"
Yusaku: "What's your size?"
Chihiro: "I-I don't know."
Yusaku: "Heh, you couldn't buy a bra if you didn't know."
Chihiro: "..."
A vulgar laugh.
His breath reeked over my shoulder.
My disgust for him grows.
A cockroach would be better than this man.
Yusaku: "Compared to Akizuki-kun..."
His hand finally left my chest, but my relief was short-lived.
Now my left arm is twisted behind my back.
Naturally, my body leans forward.
Otherwise, my joint might dislocate.
Yusaku: "...He has a small dick."
Shota: "Ugh..."
Chihiro: "..."
Stop saying such awful things.
Idiot.
Inhuman.
Chihiro: "It's not small."
Yusaku: "Is it especially shrunk today?"
Chihiro: "Please, enough is enough."
Thump.
I kick Chief Kazama's shin with my heel.
I can't stay silent when my loved one is being insulted.
Yusaku: "That hurts, madam."
Chihiro: "P-pervert."
Yusaku: "...What did you say?"
Chihiro: "Fix his pants, now."
Yusaku: "I was just worried if it wasn't crushed."
Grind.
Chihiro: "Ouch...ah..."
Probably retaliation for kicking his shin.
The joint is twisted in the opposite direction.
Yusaku: "Despite being slim, she has quite a bit of arm strength."
Giri, giri.
Chihiro: "Ah!"
Yusaku: "So I took advantage of her carelessness and kicked her in the balls."
Chihiro: "So cruel..."
Yusaku: "Well, it was a hellish agony. Thanks to that, I was able to turn the tables in one fell swoop."
Shota: "Guu..."
Yusaku: "If you're that worried, check for yourself."
Chihiro: "Huh..."
Yusaku: "See if that precious part of his is still usable."
Chihiro: "No...stop...I don't want to...I don't want to..."
Being bent forward, my buttocks are pushed by his knee.
Despite trying to resist, my body involuntarily takes a step forward.
Reluctantly, his lower abdomen is approaching before my eyes.
Chihiro: "Stop, please stop!"
Yusaku: "You're a couple, there's no need to hold back, right?"
Mugyu.
Chihiro: "Nn...uu..."
Shota: "Uuuuuuuuuuuu!!"
Yusaku: "Take it in your mouth."
Chihiro: "Nn...gu...no...ah..."
Slap!!
Chihiro: "!?"
Shota: "Gu...uu..."
Slap!!
Shota: "Hii...i..."
Chihiro: "Wait a minute..."
A sound that seemed to make fire come out of my eyes.
Shota is being hit.
Yusaku: "Nice sound."
Slap!!
Shota: "Fugi."
Chihiro: "Stop being violent!!"
Yusaku: "What happens next is up to you, Madam."
Chihiro: "Huh..."
Indescribable anger.
I've never despised someone this much.
I'm sure Shota feels the same way.
He clenches his fists over and over again.
He groaned low like a beast ready to pounce.
Yusaku: "What's with that face?"
Slap!!
Shota: "Huh..."
Slap!!
Chihiro: "Stop it already!!"
Slap!!
Shota: "Uu..."
Shota stopped screaming.
It's that frustrating.
That's why he's pretending it doesn't hurt.
Slap!!
Chihiro: "Huh..."
But I'm the one who's no good.
Every time the popping sound echoes, I feel myself shrinking.
The guilt is even worse when I think I'm the cause.
I want to free him from the pain as soon as possible.
The feeling grows stronger and stronger.
Slap!!
Chihiro: "Please..."
Slap!!
Chihiro: "Stop..."
Slap!!
Chihiro: "Huh..."
I'll take it in my mouth.
It's not a stranger.
It's Shota's penis, whom I love.
If I think we're alone, I can do that much.
Paku.
Shota: "...!!"
Chihiro: "Mm..."
Yusaku: "Oh really now..."
Chihiro: "Mm... slurp..."
Shota: "Uhh...uh..."
Yusaku: "So this is your wife's blowjob, huh."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Now, make it bigger."
I felt frustrated. I wanted to slap Mr. Hazama's cheek.
Again and again.
As many times as Shota had been hit, if not more.
But I was so powerless.
Screaming would not guarantee a change in the situation.
On the contrary, there was a possibility that Mr. Hazama might become furious.
Of course, I thought about crying and begging for forgiveness.
But I couldn't do that.
We haven't done anything wrong.
Shota's pride was probably shattered as well.
He would surely despise me if I acted servile.
Chihiro: "Slurp..."
Shota: "..."
So all I can do is keep licking.
At least for now.
If I don't, he'll get hit again.
Yusaku: "Hurry up and make it erect."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
A hand reaching for my butt.
I felt pathetic pretending not to notice.
Yusaku: "Once you get it hard, I'll let you go."
Chihiro: "Mm...slurp...slurp..."
Shota: "Uh...ah..."
Shota.
I'm sorry I'm so clumsy.
His penis remained soft.
It's being massaged inside my mouth.
There's no sign of it getting hard.
It can't be helped.
This is the situation.
Yusaku: "Akizuki."
Shota: "..."
Yusaku: "Is the problem on your end?"
Chihiro: "No... it's me..."
Yusaku: "I was asking him."
Lick.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Touched again.
This time, it was too obvious to ignore.
Yusaku: "You better get hard soon..."
Lick, lick.
Chihiro: "No... stop..."
Yusaku: "Your wife will be even more embarrassed."
Shota: "Ugh..."
Stop.
Don't touch me anymore.
The lewd fingertips of Mr. Hazama.
He kept playing with the crack of my butt persistently.
Yusaku: "Got it?"
Shota: "Uh...ah!!"
Yusaku: "Defiant, aren't you?"
Flip.
Chihiro: "!?"
Shota: "Ahhhh!!"
Yusaku: "This is what happens when you behave like that."
Chihiro: "Mr. Hazama, my...my skirt..."
Yusaku: "...Don't let his penis out of your mouth."
Slap!!
Shota: "Ah...uh..."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
The loudest sound so far.
In a panic, I quickly put his penis back into my mouth.
Yusaku: "You just need to concentrate on giving a blowjob."
Stab.
Chihiro: "Hii..."
The softest part where I don't want to be touched at all.
He pokes it as if it's a punishment.
I desperately swallow the scream that's about to come out.
The tears welling up are, of course, due to my frustration.
Yusaku: "It usually gets hard, doesn't it?"
Stab, stab.
Chihiro: "Ugh...uh..."
I can't take it anymore.
Shota.
Help me.
This person is crazy.
He's insane.
Yusaku: "...why are you taking a break?"
Stab.
Chihiro: "N-No."
Yusaku: "If you don't like it, don't slurp."
Chihiro: "Mmm...slurp...mmm...mmm..."
Shota: "Ugh...ugh..."
Yusaku: "More intensely."
Chihiro: "...slurp...slurp...slurp..."
Yusaku: "More, more..."
Chihiro: "Haa...haa...slurp, slurp...slurp...slurp..."
Chihiro: "Mmm...haa...slurp...slurp...slurp...mmm...slurp...slurp...mmm...mmm...haa...haa..."
Yusaku: "...Shota."
Shota: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "There's no reaction even after such service."
Shota: "Uhh...uh..."
Yusaku: "Your wife must be pitiful...huh?"
Squish.
Chihiro: "!!"
I just want to die.
The thin cloth that covers my precious part.
It was pinched with the flesh inside.
Even though it's over underwear, it's almost a direct sensation.
I'm probably even spilling out hair.
It's terrible.
Too terrible.
Yusaku: "...huh?"
Squish, squish...squish...
Yusaku: "It might be a bit damp."
Chihiro: "N-No..."
A vulgar laugh of mockery.
Idiot.
Being damp and being wet are different.
Chief Azuma is a person who wants to break up our relationship.
That's why he's purposely making mean remarks.
Yusaku: "...Shota."
Shota: "Guh...uh..."
Yusaku: "Your wife seems to be quite eager."
Chihiro: "...!?"
Eager?
For what?
Chihiro: "(Ah...)"
The blood drains from my face.
Chief Azuma's ultimate goal.
He's trying to make us have sex.
Slip.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "Oops..."
This person is definitely crazy.
It's not a joke.
I'm desperately struggling to untwist my twisted arm.
Chihiro: "Let go!!"
Yusaku: "What's wrong all of a sudden?"
Grind.
Chihiro: "It...hurts...ah..."
Yusaku: "Take my penis in your mouth."
Chihiro: "N-no..."
The Director, Hazama, is fully occupied trying to restrain me. He wouldn't be able to slap Shota's cheek in this state. Conversely, the arm behind my back is being increasingly twisted. I can hear a creaking sound coming from my elbow. But I can't lose. I just have to endure until morning.
Yusaku: "Quit playing around."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "You know, I could kill your husband."
Chihiro: "Wh-what...?"
Yusaku: "Think a woman's strength can stop me?"
Chihiro: "..."
That's a lie. He couldn't possibly kill someone. Logically, it's just a threat. But for some reason, my struggles cease abruptly.
Chihiro: "..."
That's right. This man isn't normal. Kill Shota? I would never allow that. I can't even imagine a life without him. It would be cruel to our unborn baby. The happy family life we envisioned is crumbling. Everything is going dark. I'm helpless. The cost of resistance is too high.
Chihiro: *gulps*
Chihiro: "Mmm..."
I took his penis in my mouth. My twisted arm remains so. But it's okay. I'm licking with much more fervor than before. It's not that I'm trying to please him. I've come to realize that I don't have the courage to risk Shota's life.
Chihiro: "Mmm... slurp... slurp... mmm... mmm... smooch..."
Yusaku: "...That's the spirit."
Chihiro: "Smooch... mmm... mmm... gasp... smooch... smooch... mmm... mmm..."
Yusaku: "But we still have to settle the score, right?"
Chihiro: "!!"
Shota: "Uuuuuuuuuuuu!!"
Yusaku: "Punishment for resisting."
Chihiro: "Mmm... smooch... smooch... smooch... slurp..."
I continue licking as if nothing had happened. I pretend so I don't faint. The realization of my pregnancy is overwhelming. My revulsion is beyond measure. There is more to protect than my chastity now. Yet, I'm exposing myself to a man who isn't my husband.
Chihiro: "..."
Again. A rush of shame makes my lower abdomen hot. It's the same sensation as before. But this time it's different from my fantasies. The disgusting Director Hazama. He must be leering at me.
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Shota: "!!"
A sensation of electricity and chills runs through my body. My precious place was directly touched. I don't want this. This place is only for Shota. Please, stop it.
Shota: "Ugh... hic...!"
Cold droplets fall on my shoulder. Tears of despair and sadness. It's needless to say whose they are. What's being done to me. He can see it clearly.
Chihiro: "...Sh-Shota."
I keep his penis in my mouth. I plead desperately.
Chihiro: "Close your eyes..."
Yusaku: "What the hell are you saying?"
Chihiro: "Uh... ugh..."
No. I don't want to be spread open. He can see inside.
Yusaku: "You keep watching closely."
Shota: "Hic... hic... sob..."
Yusaku: "What a beautiful pussy, though."
Shota: "Hee... hic... hic..."
Yusaku: "And that cute little asshole."
Shota: "Hee... ugh... h-hic... h-hee..."
Chihiro: "Ah...!"
My labia are spread even wider. With a sound that sends chills down my spine. Even I panicked at that. I don't understand myself. Shota will misunderstand.
Shota: "Hic... hic... hic..."
It's not like that. It's not because I felt something when I was touched. It's because I'm licking Shota's penis. I'm sure that's the only reason. Really. Please, believe me.
Shota: "Hic... uu... hic... u..."
Chihiro: "..."
The droplets falling on my shoulder won't stop. It's causing my heart to gradually become more disturbed. What I fear is losing Shota. That could happen even if he's safe. Can we really go back to how we were? Can we forget everything as time passes? I don't know. There's no way I can know.
Yusaku: "Crying won't get your dick hard."
Shota: "Hic... sob..."
Yusaku: "I'll wait just 5 more minutes."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "If you don't get an erection by then..."
Chihiro: "Uh... ugh..."
Yusaku: "...I'll put mine in instead."
Chihiro: "!?"
Shota: "Uuuuuuuuuu!!"
He's serious. He'll probably do as he says.
Chihiro: "Mmm... huff... ng... ng..."
I caress him more intensely than ever. Please, get hard.
Chihiro: "Huff... mmm... mmm... smooch... smooch... smooch..."
Yusaku: "One minute has passed."
Chihiro: "Ah... Mmm... Smooch... Pop... Mmm... Huff... Huff..."
I'd rather die than have sex with Section Chief Kazama. If I were to do such a thing, I could never return to normal. A wife who has accepted another man's penis. Moreover, that man is the Section Chief Kazama behind me. There's no way Shota would forgive that.
Chihiro: "Huff... Huff..."
The disgusting penis I saw in the changing room. The memory of that time comes back to me. It was black, thick like a sea cucumber. It felt like another creature was attached.
Yusaku: "Two minutes have passed."
Chihiro: "Sh-Shota..."
Shota: "Uh... Ugh..."
I'll do my best. Just look at me, who's holding your penis in my mouth. Ignore the existence of Section Chief Kazama. There are only two of us in this room. If you think that way, I'm sure you'll get hard.
Chihiro: "Mmm... Huff... Smooch... Smooch... Smooch... Mmm... Huff..."
Chihiro: "Mmm... Smooch... Mmm... Lick... Lick... Mmm... Mmm... Smooch, Smooch... Mmm... Smooch... Huff... Huff..."
Yusaku: "...You're desperate, huh?"
Chihiro: "..."
Don't say unnecessary things. Because we're alone.
Chihiro: "Mmm... Huff... Mmm... Smooch... Smooch... Huff..."
Chihiro: "Huff... Huff... Mmm... Uh... Mmm... Smooch... Smooch... Huff... Huff... Mmm... Mmm... Mmm... Huff..."
Yusaku: "Three minutes have passed."
Chihiro: "Uu..."
It's no good. His penis remains soft. It seems to have shrunk even more. What should I do? If it stays like this, I'll be violated. I'm pregnant, you know.
Yusaku: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Giving up before time's up?"
Chihiro: "P-Please..."
Yusaku: "I don't think you have time to talk."
Chihiro: "I apologize... Please forgive me..."
Shota: "..."
I finally said it. The only one who can stop this is the Section Chief. There's no escape other than appealing to his emotions. Our future depends on it. I'm sure Shota will understand.
Yusaku: "Four minutes have passed."
Chihiro: "W-Wait a minute."
Yusaku: "Tell that to the clock."
Chihiro: "I won't resist you, Section Chief, anymore."
Yusaku: "That's only natural."
Chihiro: "I'll keep quiet about what's happened until now..."
Yusaku: "Don't speak as if you're doing me a favor."
Silence.
Chihiro: "..."
The sound of a zipper being pulled down from behind. Fear is making my body tremble.
Yusaku: "...30 seconds left."
Chihiro: "W-Wait, please."
Yusaku: "Has your husband's penis hardened?"
Chihiro: "Uu..."
Yusaku: "Answer me."
Chihiro: "It hasn't... hardened..."
Yusaku: "Well, then, there's no helping it."
Chihiro: "Eek..."
Something touched my buttocks. It has the volume of an arm. But the chief's hands should be occupied. Could that have been his penis?
Chihiro: "..."
My body's trembling suddenly stopped. I'm even stiffening beyond that. It must be my misunderstanding. I'm not a horse. That's impossible.
Shota: "..."
Chihiro: "...?"
Shota's behavior is strange. His body is stiff like mine. That's not good. What is he looking at? Why is he so surprised?
Yusaku: "...Exactly five minutes."
Shota: "Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!"
Squelch.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "Spread your legs."
Squish... creak...
Chihiro: "Noooooooooo!!"
Yusaku: "If you keep them closed, the pain will increase."
Chihiro: "D-Don't put it in... Chief, please..."
I feel like I'm being torn apart. That's how violent the pressure is.
Chihiro: "Ah, ah... ah... ahhh!!"
I desperately tried to escape. But the gap given was very small. There's only enough distance to attach to Shota. Naturally, Chief Kazama closes the distance. I'm scared. I cling to him with the refrigerator. Just like a criminal waiting for execution. Now I can only tremble like a lamb. If I resist, Shota's life is at stake. Even if I appeal to his emotions, I'll be ignored. It's over. All paths are blocked. Me, caught between the two. The situation is exactly that.
Yusaku: "Blame your husband for not getting hard."
Squeeze...
Chihiro: "Ugh... ugh..."
What is this? This isn't a penis. At least it's a size I've never experienced. I don't want to compare, but it's more than twice the size of Shota's.
Chihiro: "It's... it's impossible."
Yusaku: "It doesn't seem that way, though."
Squeeze, squeeze.
Chihiro: "Hii... eeh..."
Completely ignoring the difference in size. His rude character remains the same. Chief Kazama is pushing in without hesitation.
Yusaku: "The entrance was burning with pain."
"It's small and cute, Chihiro."
The place Sho-chan praised.
I'm sure it's in a terrible state now.
Chihiro: "Please, I'll do anything... So, please..."
Yusaku: "If you'll do anything, then this is fine."
Chihiro: "But, not sex."
Yusaku: "Are you shy because it's in front of your husband?"
Squish... push... thud...
Chihiro: "Ah, uh..."
Yusaku: "... Akitsuki."
Shota: "Uh..."
Yusaku: "Don't close your eyes, watch properly."
Shota: "Uh... hic... ee..."
Yusaku: "You always run away when it's crucial."
Squeeze, squeeze, push... push...
Chihiro: "Ah, ah... it hurts... I'm tearing..."
It wasn't an exaggeration.
I'm feeling tremendous pain.
It makes losing my virginity seem like a joke.
This isn't a penis after all.
It's just a torture tool to inflict pain on women.
Push... ugh...
Chihiro: "No... it really, really hurts..."
Shota: "Hic... ugh..."
Yusaku: "Your beloved wife is being tied to her boss."
Push... push... push... push...
Yusaku: "You should be delighted as a subordinate, right?"
Shota: "Hic... eee..."
Chihiro: "..."
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
I'm being violated.
But there's nothing I can do.
I can't do anything on my own.
Push... thud... ugh...
Chihiro: "Ugh... ugh..."
This is the worst.
It's not just the thickness that's different.
The length is also extraordinary.
It's far beyond the usual depth.
It feels like it's reaching my stomach, not just my womb.
Naturally, my consciousness goes to my stomach.
I was a bit dazed from the pain.
I need to pull myself together.
That's the only place I have to protect at all costs.
Chihiro: "It can't go in any further."
Yusaku: "But there's still some left at the base."
Chihiro: "No, I can't anymore."
Yusaku: "Is that so?"
Thud...
Chihiro: "Hic..."
Thud, thud...
Chihiro: "No... Ahh..."
Please, stop.
The penis is bending inside my stomach.
The tip is already sticking to the entrance of my womb.
It's so close I can feel the round shape.
But Chief Yazama doesn't release the pressure at all.
He's thrusting his hips as if there's still room inside.
Thud... ugh...
Chihiro: "No... I can't... I can't take it anymore..."
I'm getting destroyed.
Not just the baby, but everything.
Chihiro: "Um, Manager Yuusaku..."
Yuusaku: "Save your resentments for the cowardly Akizuki, your husband."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I understand.
Crying or apologizing won't help.
I don't expect him to stop anymore.
Chihiro: "I, I prefer it from the front."
Yuusaku: "What?"
Shota: "Uh..."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Even Shota looks surprised.
He might think I've gone mad.
Yuusaku: "What do you mean?"
Chihiro: "Of, of course, sex..."
Yuusaku: "But then you can't cling to your beloved husband."
Chihiro: "Ah...I'll endure it."
Shota: "Uh...Uh..."
A position that would minimize the damage.
If he did it normally, he wouldn't be hitting so deep.
But asking him outright was impossible.
So, I had no choice but to pretend to plead.
Yuusaku: "So, you like it from the front, huh?"
Chihiro: "Yes, I like it."
Shota: "Huh..."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I'm sorry.
Please forgive me just this once.
I'll apologize properly later.
Yuusaku: "There seems to be some kind of reason..."
Grit.
Chihiro: "Ah, ah, ah!!"
Yuusaku: "Do you feel it when you're hit from behind?"
Grit, grit.
Chihiro: "No...that's not it..."
Yuusaku: "Tell me honestly."
Spurt, spurt, throb, throb, throb, throb...
Chihiro: "Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah..."
Spurt, spurt, throb...throb...throb...throb...throb....
Chihiro: "Ah~...ah, it's still coming out...uh..."
Yuusaku: "Yes, it's the best..."
Throb, throb...throb...throb...gush...
Chihiro: "Eek...don't put any more inside...don't put in any more semen..."
Throb...throb...throb....
Yuusaku: "Huh...ha..."
Chihiro: "Huh..."
Pull...
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yuusaku: "You think it's over?"
Chihiro: "!"
Pull...pop...
Chihiro: "No...stop..."
Yuusaku: "I'm going to violate you at least 10 more times."
Shota: "Uh...uh...huh..."
Thrust...thrust...squish...slip...thrust...uh...
Chihiro: "Ah...ah...hic...hic...eek..."
Chihiro: "Agg...uh...haa...haa...no, no more...ah...ah...ah...someone help...someone...help..."
