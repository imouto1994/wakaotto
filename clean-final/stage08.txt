...7:00 AM...
Shouta: "Section Chief, good morning."
Yuusaku: "Hey."
Chihiro: "..."
Yuusaku: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "...!"
Yuusaku: "Why is your wife with you?"
Chihiro: "I, I also have some errands to run..."
Shouta: "I apologize, Section Chief."
Shouta: "She has some business in the next town over, so we thought we might as well go together."
Chihiro: "N, no, um..."
Shouta: "Actually, I'm the one who insisted on going with her."
Yuusaku: "Huh…"
He's lying.
Chihiro must have asked him to come along, right?
Playing the loving husband protecting his wife, huh.
Nice.
That's sure to get my blood pumping.
Shouta: "By the way, Section Chief, about last night's incident..."
Yuusaku: "You mean how I suddenly left?"
Shouta: "Y-yes... sort of..."
Yuusaku: "I forgot the documents you made. I needed them for the inspection, so I hurried back to get them."
Shouta: "Oh, is that what happened? I thought maybe you felt uncomfortable, so I worried unnecessarily."
Yuusaku: "..."
I felt quite comfortable.
Especially while you were asleep.
Yuusaku: "By the way, madam..."
Chihiro: "Y-yes?"
Yuusaku: "Are we taking the train together by any chance?"
Chihiro: "Eh…"
Yuusaku: "I bet we are."
Chihiro: "Yes, we... are..."
Yuusaku: "That's good."
Chihiro: "Why is that?"
Yuusaku: "Because it seems like we'll have a lively conversation in the train."
Chihiro: "Oh…"
I turned my back to hide my smirk.
I then headed for the station stairs.
Her outfit is perfect.
She understood exactly what I said.
Is she looking a bit worn out from lack of sleep?
Or is her anxiety showing on her face?
Could be.
She's an honest person.
But she can relax.
I'll take good care of her.
She's going to be over the moon in front of her husband.
This will surely be a day she won't forget.
…
Shouta: "It's quite crowded, as expected."
Yuusaku: "It's the peak of the morning commute."
Shouta: "Ever since they introduced women-only carriages, it seems to have gotten worse..."
Yuusaku: "If you have a complaint, tell it to the perverts."
Shouta: "Well, yes, but it's particularly bad today..."
Chihiro: "Ah…"
Shouta: "...Are you uncomfortable?"
Chihiro: "Y-yes, I'm fine..."
Yuusaku: "..."
You're not really fine, are you?
The bad premonition right after boarding.
You started getting your butt stroked by me even before the doors closed.
As it looks, it's well shaped.
It's plump like a teenage girl's.
But I'm done enjoying the feel of your ass.
It's enough that I could confirm you're holding back.
Peel.
Chihiro: "Ah…"
Now comes the main event.
I quickly lift the hem of your skirt.
I slide my hand inside, where the air is warming.
Chihiro: "Ah…uh…"
Chihiro clings to her husband's chest.
How does it feel?
To be toyed with in front of the person you love.
"I belong only to my husband."
You should realize how trite that phrase is.
Of course, when it comes to nastiness, I won't lose to anyone.
I'm not just going to torment and let you know.
I'm aiming for a much higher level.
See?
The movement of my fingers is different from when I groped you before, right?
Chihiro: "Mm…uh…"
Shouta: "Are you feeling unwell?"
Chihiro: "N-no…"
Shouta: "Your face is a bit red…"
Yuusaku: "Maybe you're sick from the crowd on the train after a long time?"
Chihiro: "(Ah…uh…)"
Such an obvious lie.
It's all your fault.
I almost wanted to scream that.
The fingers groping my important parts.
Concentrating on the most sensitive part.
With a touch so subtle it gives me chills.
It doesn't feel like the teasing from the other time.
That's why it's even more disgusting.
A whimper leaks out from the unbearable sensation.
No matter how small I keep it, it's different from a mere sigh.
Stop it.
Why are you always so mean?
Shouta is right in front of me.
There are so many people around.
What if they look at me with strange eyes?
Rub... rub... squeeze…
Chihiro: "Ah…uh…"
Rub, rub… rub… squeeze…
Chihiro: "Hi…no…stop…"
Shouta: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "..."
I shook my head.
I indicated with just my attitude that it was nothing.
If I put it into words, it might sound strange.
The movement of the fingers is getting more and more rhythmic.
It's hard to find a gap where I can act normally.
Even if I hold back, my body reacts on its own.
I can't do anything about it with my own will.
Squeeze…
Chihiro: "N-no…"
Rub... rub... rub… squeeze…
Chihiro: "Ah…uh…"
Even if I twist my body, it's no use.
Even if I try to change my standing position, it's impossible.
The section chief's fingers remain attached.
All I could do was shrink and endure.
The only relief was that I could cling to Shouta.
But doing so also made my sense of guilt stronger.
Me, being toyed with in front of the person I love.
All to get a single photo deleted.
This is probably the price for that.
Chihiro: "Uh…ah…"
Shouta: "…?"
I was looked at again with a puzzled expression.
Moreover, it's not just Shouta anymore.
The middle-aged salaryman next to him.
He also started giving me a suspicious look.
It's embarrassing.
My thighs, pressed together, are trembling.
Squeeze.
Chihiro: "Ah…"
It's happening again.
The area around my navel tightens.
And it's not just once.
Over and over again.
Plus, there's even an unpleasant sound from inside my skirt.
