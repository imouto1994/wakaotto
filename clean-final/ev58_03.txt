Chihiro: "Mmm... slobber... mm..."
I'm sorry, Shota.
I'm really sorry.
The only one I love is you.
But, but...
I can't help but degrade myself like this.
I can't even utter words of apology.
A stupid woman who lusts after a penis other than her husband's.
Because that's what suits me right now.
Yusaku: "Akizuki."
Shota: "Y-yes."
Yusaku: "Don't trouble your wife too much."
Shota: "..."
Yusaku: "A young man who monopolizes happiness, are you jealous of an old man like me?"
Shota: "N-no, it's not like... that..."
Yusaku: "You really do love your wife, don't you?"
Shota: "W-well, we're a couple, so naturally..."
Yusaku: "By that logic, she feels the same way."
Shota: "W-what do you mean?"
Yusaku: "She loves you, her dear husband, very much."
Shota: "I'd be happy if that were true..."
Yusaku: "Why are you saying such negative things? It's not a hypothetical, it's the reality... right?"
Chihiro: "Mmm... slobber... squelch... mmm..."
Yusaku: "...Your wife is nodding vigorously."
Shota: "I-I can't show off in front of my boss."
Yusaku: "...There's no need to be so considerate."
Chihiro: "Mmm... slurp... mmm... s-sigh..."
Yusaku: "I'm truly envious of you."
Shota: "M-my boss is envious of me?"
Yusaku: "Akizuki, you have a fulfilling life, both publicly and privately."
Shota: "I-I wish I could be like my boss who is capable at work..."
Yusaku: "I'm useless because my personal life is hollow."
Shota: "T-that's not true."
Yusaku: "I'm too old and still can't get married."
Shota: "B-but, someday my boss will definitely meet a wonderful woman..."
Yusaku: "Is that so?"
Shota: "Y-yes, it is."
Yusaku: "But there aren't many people like your wife, are there?"
Shota: "W-well, a woman like Chihiro is..."
Yusaku: "...You're showing off too."
Shota: "S-sorry."
Yusaku: "Well, I understand the feeling of wanting to brag."
Chihiro: "Mmm... slurp... ah... mmm... mmm..."
Yusaku: "...She's good-looking in anyone's eyes."
Chihiro: "Slobber... mmm... slurp... mmm... slurp..."
Yusaku: "She's attractive, cheerful, and kind."
Chihiro: "Mmm... mm... gulp... slurp... mm... mmm..."
Yusaku: "A wife who prioritizes serving her husband."
Chihiro: "Uh... mmm... ah... mmm... mmm... slurp... ah..."
Yusaku: "Of course, she doesn't slack off on cleaning and laundry."
Chihiro: "Ah... mmm... mmm... gag... slurp... mmm... squelch..."
Yusaku: "And on top of that, her cooking skills are top-notch."
Jerk.
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yusaku: "...And as a bonus, her breasts are Holstein-class."
Chihiro: "Eh..."
Again, the boss speaks in a low voice.
But perhaps it's hard to regulate with his rough breathing.
It's not an even volume like before.
Could it be that he's excited too?
His penis pulses and throbs.
I can feel even the protruding veins hardening.
Signs of imminent ejaculation.
That means, right next to my dear husband...
I'm about to receive my boss's semen...
Yusaku: "Even your pussy tightens in two places."
Chihiro: "Mmm... gasp... uh..."
I can't go on.
Please, don't say anything more.
Every time my heart pounds, my lower belly tingles.
Lewd drops seem about to drip onto the floor.
Yusaku: "I want to cum inside you again."
Chihiro: "Mmm... sob... mmm... slurp... uh..."
Yusaku: "Just like we did in the station restroom..."
Jerk, tremble.
Chihiro: "Ugh... gulp... uh..."
It's coming.
He's about to ejaculate in my mouth.
Yusaku: "Ah, I realized I hadn't properly thanked you."
Chihiro: "Mmm... slurp... mmm... ha... mmm... mmm..."
Yusaku: "Ah, for serving such delicious food..."
Twitch, twitch, twitch... uh...
Chihiro: "Hum... mmm... gulp... mmm... smooch..."
Yusaku: "Re-really, thank you for the meal..."
Splurt!!
Chihiro: "Gasp... uh... mm..."
Yusaku: "...It was."
