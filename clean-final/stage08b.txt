Chihiro: "Uh...uh..."
Chihiro, about 5 meters ahead...
She appears awkward even in her walk.
She looks beaten from the continuous trials.
What a fool.
It's because she's rubbing her thighs together more than necessary.
Walking normally would attract much less attention.
She's been acting suspicious since we got off the train.
She flinches at the sight of others.
Every time she passes someone...
She hunches her shoulders.
She's gradually walking towards the edge of the street.
She's about to bump into someone who just came out of a store.
Chihiro: "Eek...!"
See?
I told you.
This time, it's not a person but an abandoned bicycle.
She nearly trips over the bag she's carrying.
Pull yourself together.
You don't want to expose yourself on the street, do you?
I find that more interesting, though.
If that happens, I'll pretend to be a bystander and make a big fuss.
I'll gather as many people as possible.
...
Yusaku: "..."
Damn.
We arrived safely.
Well, whatever.
Chihiro: "Um..."
Yusaku: "Why did you stop?"
Chihiro: "I, I can't go any further..."
Yusaku: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "...Because of the neighbors."
Yusaku: "Then go ahead and unlock the door."
Chihiro: "Huh, are you coming in?"
Yusaku: "..."
I turn away, pretending to admire the view.
In other words, I don't want to hear it.
Chihiro: "...Please go home today."
Yusaku: "If you're okay with not deleting the photos, I will."
Chihiro: "Th, that's not what we agreed on."
Yusaku: "We haven't reached the equivalent of one photo yet."
Chihiro: "I, I've endured enough. What happened on the train, being molested in front of my husband..."
Yusaku: "So?"
Chihiro: "If I keep complying, there will be no end to this."
Yusaku: "...I see."
I nod and take out my mobile phone.
I set up the group molestation photo on the display.
Chihiro is the one surprised.
She looks at me quizzically, not expecting such straightforwardness.
Yusaku: "Do you want to press the button, ma'am?"
Chihiro: "...Is the data only in your phone?"
Yusaku: "I prefer not to make copies of this sort of thing. I'd rather carry it with me at all times."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "If you think I'm lying, come to my house."
Chihiro: "I, I believe you."
Yusaku: "That's an honor."
Chihiro: "Please, just press the button, Manager."
Yusaku: "Sure thing."
*Beep*
Yusaku: "Deletion complete."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Must be a weight off your shoulders."
Chihiro: "...There's one more photo."
Yusaku: "If you want, I can delete that one too."
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Yusaku: "It would be a fresh start for you, wouldn't it?"
Chihiro: "Are you... going to delete it... right here?"
Yusaku: "If you allow me to enter your room."
Chihiro: "...You're planning to do something else, aren't you?"
Yusaku: "Well..."
Chihiro: "Please be clear."
Yusaku: "That's not something to discuss out here."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Yusaku: "What will you do?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "I think you'd feel much better if the disgusting photo was completely gone from this world..."
Chihiro: "I'll... unlock the door..."
Yusaku: "...Unlock it?"
Chihiro: "...I'll wait for you in the room."
Yusaku: "..."
Yusaku: "Hmm."
Maybe she's made up her mind to settle this.
Or maybe she no longer has to worry about the eyes of others.
The blood returns slightly to her pale face.
Her walk finally returns to normal when she reaches here.
...
I follow her almost immediately.
Her arousal should still be at its peak from her embarrassment.
It's been left to mature over time.
It wouldn't do if she wiped it off herself.
...
*Ding Dong*
Yusaku: "..."
Chihiro: "Yes?"
The door isn't locked.
But I press the doorbell anyway.
Chihiro is taken aback by my unexpected action.
Come on.
Hurry up and greet me.
Yusaku: "I'm home."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Shall I take a bath first today?"
Chihiro: "This isn't the time to... to be joking around."
Yusaku: "I've always wanted to try this."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "You don't want me to be your partner?"
Chihiro: "Is that... the price for deleting the data?"
Yusaku: "No way."
Chihiro: "Please tell me what I need to do."
Yusaku: "First, put down your bag."
Chihiro: "I want to finish this as soon as possible. I don't want to worry about you anymore."
Yusaku: "Really..."
Are you willing to do anything for that?
You talk as if you're not at fault
Yusaku: "So, are you saying you'll do anything for that?"
Chihiro: "No, no one has said anything like that."
Yusaku: "You've been obedient all this time, haven't you?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Don't start posturing now."
Chihiro: "There are things I can and can't endure..."
Yusaku: "You've got some nerve saying that."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "Even though you had semen splashed under your armpits."
Chihiro: "That was you forcing it on me..."
Yusaku: "Despite giving a blowjob and swallowing my semen."
Chihiro: "S-stop it..."
Yusaku: "So, reaching climax from my fingers is within your tolerance?"
Chihiro: "I-I didn't reach any climax..."
Yusaku: "At the end, you even showed your pussy in the middle of a train."
Yusaku: "You talk as if you've done nothing wrong."
Chihiro: "Are you saying it's my fault?"
Yusaku: "If there were no openings from your side, this would have ended a long time ago."
Chihiro: "Don't force your arbitrary reasons onto me."
Yusaku: "You're not being persistent because you think you're attractive, are you?"
Chihiro: "No one is saying anything like that..."
Yusaku: "You're as self-absorbed as ever."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Despite being unattractive."
Chihiro: "I don't care about that..."
Yusaku: "Even though you have breasts like a cow."
Chihiro: "It's not like I wanted them to grow this big..."
Yusaku: "And your genitals are so dark and ugly."
Chihiro: "T-that's harsh..."
Yusaku: "I'm surprised your husband can even touch you."
Chihiro: "Your penis is also..."
Yusaku: "..."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "Go on, say it."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Hurry up and insult me."
Chihiro: "...No."
Yusaku: "There's no need to hold back."
Chihiro: "It's the lowest to make fun of someone's body."
Yusaku: "So even though your body is dirty, your heart is pure."
Chihiro: "Are you here to say cruel things to me?"
Yusaku: "Of course not."
Yusaku moves closer.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
For once...
Chihiro didn't back away.
Yusaku: "Actually, I'm thirsty."
Chihiro: "So what?"
Yusaku: "It was very hot today."
Chihiro: "It's summer, it's supposed to be hot."
Yusaku: "Don't get so worked up."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "If you quench my thirst, I'll delete the data."
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Yusaku: "Isn't it good that it's something simple?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "At least make a happy face."
Chihiro: "That's impossible."
Yusaku: "What is?"
Chihiro: "I can't believe this issue can be resolved just by serving tea."
Yusaku: "Heh heh..."
Well...
It seems this level of tactic no longer works.
Yusaku: "I didn't lie though..."
Then...
Stare~~~~.
Chihiro: "!?"
While keeping eye contact with Chihiro...
I slowly lowered my pants' zipper.
Yet, Chihiro doesn't flinch.
She hides her anxiety and puts on a brave front.
Yusaku: "...What I want to drink is your juice."
Chihiro: "Ju-juice?"
Yusaku: "Yes."
Chihiro: "I, I don't understand what you're saying."
With a rustle.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I pull my throbbing penis out of my pants.
I ostentatiously point it towards Chihiro.
Of course, the tip is already oozing with a clear drop.
With just a little squeeze, it looks like it's about to drip.
Yusaku: "You also have this kind of thing, don't you?"
With a squeeze... and a drip...
Chihiro: "No, no..."
Yusaku: "Pour it into my mouth."
Leaving the stunned Chihiro behind...
I lie down in a spread-eagle position, still holding my penis.
The room is well-cleaned.
The ceiling is pure white.
It feels good.
I seriously want to make this my own home.
Yusaku: "What's the matter?"
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "Hurry up and straddle me."
Chihiro: "That... I can't..."
Yusaku: "..."
From here, I can see Chihiro standing nearby.
From this angle, it almost looks like I can see her pussy.
But she doesn't even hold down her skirt.
She doesn't retreat either, she just stands there.
Her expression looks deeply troubled.
It's as if determination is oozing out of her face.
Chihiro: "...Promise me this will end."
Yusaku: "You sound as if you're carrying all the world's misfortune."
Chihiro: "Don't mock me."
Yusaku: "Without a weakness, you would have no reason to obey me."
Chihiro: "Swear you'll never get involved with me again."
Yusaku: "If that's what you want."
Chihiro: "Of course I want it."
Yusaku: "Then we have a deal."
Chihiro: "Can you put your mobile phone away?"
Yusaku: "I don't mind."
I take out the phone from my breast pocket.
I slid my phone across the polished wooden floor.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Chihiro hesitates for just a moment...
But then slowly raises the edges of her skirt.
She awkwardly straddles my face, which is looking straight up at her.
Probably doesn't want me to see her backside.
She's still standing, and her body is facing this way.
Of course, she can't meet my eyes directly.
Chihiro: "I... I've straddled you."
Yusaku: "Now, without changing your standing position, squat."
Chihiro: "What!?"
Yusaku: "If you're too far away, I can't aim properly."
Chihiro: "Are... are we supposed to touch?"
Yusaku: "I guess you can't do that, can you?"
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "Then, let's forget about ending this and just stay good friends forever."
Chihiro: "I... I can squat."
Yusaku: "Oh really?"
Is that true?
I mischievously follow Chihiro's evading gaze.
Yusaku: "That's impressive."
Chihiro: "If it means cutting ties with you, I'd even go to hell."
Yusaku: "..."
That's something.
She's really starting to lower her hips.
She's unaware of what's happening to her own body.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Chihiro's crotch is approaching.
The way she's positioned, like she's about to pee, is oddly arousing.
Yusaku: "Which is more embarrassing, spreading your legs on a train or this?"
Chihiro: "I... I don't know."
Yusaku: "Haha..."
She's desperate.
She doesn't have the composure to answer properly, huh?
The crevice that's starting to open is still full of nectar.
Even the pubic hair on the soft flesh is shiny.
She's been panty-less since then, that hasn't changed.
That's why the obscene secretion doesn't stop.
This is great.
Because I know the usual her, this is the best.
Hurry up and let me drink.
The thick juice that a chaste wife drips.
Drip...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Squish...
Chihiro: "!!"
Yusaku: "Hmm... gr..."
Chihiro: "Wait... a... moment..."
Idiot.
It's too late to notice the anomaly now.
You don't know your own body too well.
If you think you're just wet, you're greatly mistaken.
Yusaku: "Ha... hmm..."
Chihiro: "Hii!!"
I pull Chihiro's hips closer than she wants.
I then bite into the soft flesh of the crevice.
Yusaku: "Urgh... ha... ah..."
Chihiro: "Ah... ah... ah..."
Yusaku: "Slurp... ha... mmm..."
Chihiro: "N-no... what is... this...?"
*Wet sounds*
Chihiro: "Hyaa... ah...!!"
Her slit is only getting more ruffled.
In no time, it's soaking wet with juice and saliva.
The stifling heat almost chokes me.
Her ragged breathing only serves to widen the gap even more.
Impressive, Mrs.
You're more ripe than I thought.
The scent of your pheromones is much stronger, too.
And yet, you're as scared as a lamb being sheared.
You're probably hyper-sensitive to even a breeze.
That's understandable.
After fainting, you've piled up so much shame.
You were so shrunken that you couldn't walk normally at the end.
I genuinely sympathize with you.
With your complicated body, Mrs.
*Wet sounds*
Chihiro: "Huh..."
*Wet sounds*
Chihiro: "Huh... No, no...!"
*Wet sounds*
Chihiro: "(Gasp...! Help... me...)"
Electricity runs through my body.
It started the moment I lowered my hips.
I can't understand what's happening.
It's as if all the mucous membrane of my genitals was stripped off.
That's how intense the stimulation feels.
The part being toyed with is so hot it feels like it's burning.
The numbness that arises there is far from ordinary.
It quickly permeates every corner of my body.
It demands a lewd response from me whether I want it or not.
No matter how hard I grit my teeth, it's useless.
I can't help but make a voice that might be misunderstood.
*Wet sounds*
Chihiro: "Aggh... Ah... Ah... Huh...!"
*Wet sounds*
Chihiro: "Gasp... Grunt... Uh... Ah... Ah... Ah...!"
*Wet sounds*
Chihiro: "Ah, guh... Hii...!"
My lower belly visibly throbs.
Even my limbs go limp from the unwanted sensations.
Chihiro: "..."
To be honest, I panicked.
It was similar to when I was molested in front of my husband.
The only difference was the speed of the sequence.
It happened so quickly, I had no time to digest the situation.
It's probably been less than two minutes since I squatted.
And yet, I'm already terrified of the signs of climax.
I can feel something about to melt any moment now.
Chihiro: "Gasp... Grunt..."
I'm about to cum.
This is no joke, really.
I'm panicking from the worst possible outcome.
This makes me look like a horny woman starved for sex.
Of course, I was somewhat prepared.
But I won't repeat the disgraceful act in the train.
I didn't think it would go that far.
This baseless overconfidence is seriously backfiring.
Chihiro: "Ugh... Hm..."
I must pull myself together.
I can't waste the courage it took to squat.
What's needed is not self-esteem, but cutting off my involvement with this man.
For that, I have no choice but to endure the shame now.
My memories in the train only go up until just before I fainted.
So, I didn't realize I had climaxed.
An orgasm given by a man other than Shō-chan.
Contrasting with my flushed body, my heart freezes.
Chihiro: "Ugh... Ah..."
At any rate, I'll avoid letting out any particularly suggestive moans.
I'm sure they would be taken advantage of by the chief.
I can't give him that opportunity.
Chihiro: "Uh... Haa... Haa..."
While writhing in agony, I confirmed the position of my phone.
The moment of blankness possible during climax.
Right now, even that was scary.
It's okay.
It's in a place beyond my reach.
A little relief for my calm self.
All that's left is to brace myself and prepare to endure.
To keep my sanity, I bit down hard on my back teeth.
*Twitch, twitch*
Chihiro: "Hii... Hm..."
Below my navel spasms uncontrollably.
When I try to forcibly endure, my hips sway back and forth.
A movement like rubbing the chief's jaw with my own intimate lips.
Enough already.
It's like I'm begging for something.
From my lower abdomen, a lewd sound.
Not a sob, but a gesture that gives me away.
Chihiro: "Uh... Hm... Ugh... Ah... Ha... Ah..."
I'm coming.
Or rather, I'm already coming.
Please end it quickly.
As quickly as possible.
Please, God...
*Twitch... twitch, twitch... twitch...*
Chihiro: "Ugh... Hmm..."
The pleasure I'm used to.
It's frustrating that it's the same even with someone I hate.
But somehow, I can keep up appearances.
I'm sure I can fool him with this.
*Squish... twitch... twitch...*
Chihiro: "Hm... Ugh... Haa... Haa..."
My insides are tingling.
It's a bit ticklish.
Small spasms in my stomach from the afterglow of climaxing.
My body is confused by the unfamiliar sensation.
Of course, it's a faint tremor, so it doesn't reach the chief.
Chihiro: "Ah... Huh..."
It's over.
At least I've overcome one thing for sure.
All that's left is to wait for the devil below to get bored.
I just have to endure the revulsion of being sucked.
*Squish... twitch...*
Chihiro: "Huh...?"
*Twitch, twitch... twitch...*
Chihiro: "Ugh... Hm... Huh...?"
This is strange.
The spasms aren't subsiding.
In fact, they're gradually getting worse.
*Suck... slurp... twitch... twitch...*
Chihiro: "Hi... Hm..."
What is this?
The climax that had been fading is surging back.
It's as if time is being rewound.
The trembling in my lower abdomen intensifies.
Even the vagina that was ticklish is now tingling.
Chihiro: "Ah... Ah... Ahh..."
No.
It won't stop.
I'm starting to feel strange again.
This isn't right.
The chief's tongue, writhing persistently.
Its squirming is inviting me to climax again.
I've never experienced consecutive orgasms before.
Was the climax earlier an illusion?
No.
I definitely climaxed.
So why again...?
*Twitch.*
Chihiro: "Ah... Hm..."
*Twitch... twitch...*
Chihiro: "Please, stop...!"
What I had vowed before straddling.
I won't cry out.
As much as possible, I'll pretend to be unresponsive.
Because I thought that was the best way to end this quickly.
But I can't anymore.
The determination I had made on my own is now as precarious as a candle in the wind.
Chihiro: "Enough is enough, please."
Yusaku: "Slurp... Ah..."
Chihiro: "Hic... Hi..."
There's no reply.
It's as if he can see right through my predicament.
A clear malice I can somehow feel.
That's how confident his tongue movements are.
Chihiro: "P-please... stop... uh..."
My words are stuck.
Gradually, I'm losing the ability to talk properly.
*Squish... slurp... twitch...*
Chihiro: "Ugh... Haa..."
Please.
Don't stimulate me anymore.
I don't want to come twice.
Fear drives me to try and lift my hips.
But the chief anticipates even that and won't let me.
*Slurp... squish... slurp...*
Chihiro: "Hic... Hi... Hi... Hm..."
*Squish... suck... slurp... twitch... twitch...*
Chihiro: "Ahh... Haa... No... Ah... Ah... Haa..."
*Twitch... twitch, twitch...*
Chihiro: "Ah... Ah~... Stop... No more... Can't... Ugh..."
I'm really going to come.
The pleasure from earlier is returning.
*Twitch... twitch...*
Chihiro: "Hic... Ugh... Haa... Hm..."
There's no time to brace myself for the emergency.
My upper body, beginning to become defenseless, is seductively twisting.
No.
Even just that gesture is no longer concealable.
Chihiro: "Ugh... Haa... Ah..."
The piercing gaze of the chief.
I'm being watched.
With those cold, snake-like eyes, intently...
*Twitch, twitch, twitch...*
Chihiro: "(I'm... I'm coming...)"
No.
I don't want to be seen climaxing.
It's embarrassing, Shou-chan.
*Twitch, twitch... twitch...*
Chihiro: "Ahh... Uhh!"
*Squeeze... twitch...*
My vagina contracts in orgasm.
It feels just as good as the first time.
But the confusion comes after that.
The pleasure doesn't curve.
Somehow, it's in a state of horizontal flight after reaching its peak.
I'm still floating in the sweet waves of honey.
*Twitch... twitch...*
Chihiro: "Ah... Ugh... Hm... Ugh..."
Desperately, I wait for the spasms to subside.
In mockery of that, my vagina shivers.
My heart freezes at my own misunderstanding.
It's not in horizontal flight.
It's still slowly rising.
I should be climaxing, but there's still more ahead.
It's frightening.
The premonition of having something important taken away.
Maybe something incredible is about to happen.
Help me.
Shou-chan.
Chihiro: "Ah... Ah..."
*Twitch, twitch, twitch... squeeze...*
Chihiro: "Ah... Ahhhhhh... Ah... Ah... Ah..."
*Squeeze, squeeze... squeeze...*
Chihiro: "No... Ah... Ah... Haa... Ah... Hm..."
It's here.
Something amazing, it's here.
An unbelievable amount of pleasure.
My body is melting.
Collapsing.
Everything is breaking.
Someone stop this animalistic noise.
A moan I've never even let Shou-chan hear.
This isn't me.
But if I hold it in, I feel like I'll faint.
Even without that, my mind is all muddled.
My vision is whitening from the outrageous orgasm.
Chihiro: "Ag... Ag... Haa... Haa... Haa... Hm..."
Frantically, I bite down hard on my tongue.
I can't lose consciousness.
Before, it was acceptable because Shou-chan was there.
Now, it's just the chief and me in this enclosed space.
The only one I can rely on is myself.
So, I have to hold on.
Otherwise, I won't know what he'll do to me.
He'll surely take another picture.
Even the possibility of being violated while unconscious...
*Lick... slurp...*
Chihiro: "Hic... Ugh... Hm..."
*Squish...*
Chihiro: "Please, stop... Chief..."
*Squish... twist... slurp...*
Chihiro: "Please, respond..."
*Squish... lick... slurp... drip...*
Chihiro: "Hii... Ah... Oh... Ugh... Haa..."
Please...
Say something.
Don't ignore me.
Allow me to rest for a bit.
If this continues, I'll go mad.
The incessant wriggling of Chief's tongue.
The pleasure is also not curving down.
The climax I reach when making love with Sho.
Now it's stuck right near that.
Almost like an ongoing orgasm.
My lower abdomen undulates with the unusual treatment.
The numbness in my vagina seems to reach the womb any moment now.
*Suck... slurp...*
Chihiro: "Ah... Ahhh... Ah... Ah..."
*Squish... lick... suck...*
Chihiro: "Haa... Ahh... Ah... Ahh... Haa... Ahh..."
*Squish... twitch...*
Chihiro: "Ugh... Haa... Ah... Mm..."
The sweat of agony.
My body throbs uncontrollably.
I just can't stop it.
Could I be climaxing again?
That's absolutely not allowed.
Three times in a row is impossible.
I'll become a true nymphomaniac.
*Squish... lick...*
Chihiro: "Haaa... Ugh... Ah... Haa..."
*Slurp... suck... squish...*
Chihiro: "Ah... Hii... Haa... Haa... Ahh... Haa... Ah..."
I need to calm down.
I get led astray when I get scared like this.
Who am I?
"Chihiro Akizuki"...
I'm Sho's wife.
Somehow, I managed to look at my left hand.
The silver wedding ring on my middle finger.
My feelings, about to fall into hell, are pulled back just a little.
It's okay.
I'm not a nymphomaniac.
So, I won't climax anymore.
Because I'm married.
Because I have a kind and beloved husband.
Because I'm carrying the child of my dear one.
*Squish... slurp...*
Chihiro: "Nooo... Ugh... Ugh... Haa..."
My brain is numb.
I'll lose if it goes on like this.
Let's think of something more pleasant.
For example, after I cut ties with the Chief.
I, waking up next to Sho as usual.
The happy mornings that repeat as a matter of course.
The only concern is what to cook for dinner.
Of course, the weird photos...
*Squish... twitch...*
Chihiro: "Ugh!!"
*Squish... squeeze... lick...*
Chihiro: "Aha... Ugh... Ugh... No... Ah..."
Please.
Don't pull me back to reality.
I don't want to confront myself as I am now.
If I did, I...
Squish... lick... slurp... poke...
Chihiro: "Hah... oh... gasp... haa... ah... ah..."
Rub... squish... twitch...
Chihiro: "Ah... ugh... stop... no more... I can't..."
I can't stand it.
I'm going to climax again.
I'm in a state of constant climax, but I'm going to climax again.
There can't be anything more.
I can't possibly stay sane.
I can't just let out animal-like moans anymore.
I'm crying and screaming like a mad woman.
In a voice so obscene it's unbelievable.
The section chief must be laughing at me.
I'll be ridiculed as long as I live.
Every time we meet, I'll be tormented because of this.
Chihiro: "Please... enough... have mercy..."
Yusaku: "Squish... slurp..."
Chihiro: "Please... I beg you..."
Yusaku: "...What exactly do you want me to forgive?"
Chihiro: "Ah, ah..."
He spoke.
But his mouth is still attached to my precious part.
His hot breath is blown into my vagina.
It throbs more than when it's licked.
Chihiro: "Please... let go... ah..."
Yusaku: "What exactly should I let go?"
Chihiro: "Your... your lips..."
Yusaku: "From where?"
Chihiro: "From... down there."
Yusaku: "Down there?"
Slurp... twitch...
Chihiro: "No... ah... ah... ah!"
It feels good.
Despite my words of refusal, my vagina feels like it's melting.
Yusaku: "Say it in words suitable for the current you."
Chihiro: "Hii... ah... haa... your breath is... inside me..."
Yusaku: "If you answer in a four-letter word, I might stop."
Chihiro: "Ah... no way... haa... ah... ah... ah..."
Yusaku: "You should know at least that much, madam."
Slurp... lick... lick... lick...
Chihiro: "Haa... ah... ah..."
Yusaku: "What place am I licking?"
Chihiro: "I... I can't say... something like that..."
Yusaku: "So you're saying you want me to continue?"
Chihiro: "No... that's not..."
Squish... slurp...
Chihiro: "Hic... ugh... ha... ah... ah..."
I'm gasping for breath because of the intense pleasure.
Yet, the section chief inflicts further torment.
His tongue invades me.
My vaginal opening obscenely spread.
My bud is exposed more than ever.
The sharp tip rubs against the section chief's lips.
Each time, I let out a sob-like moan.
Chihiro: "Aggh... aggh... aah... ah..."
Ah... N-Not there...
Ah... ah... ah...
Yusaku: "Hehe..."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I was laughed at.
I was made fun of.
I'm sorry, Sho-chan.
I can't do anything by myself.
But this is the last time.
I won't let anyone but Sho-chan touch me again.
It won't feel good unless it's Sho-chan.
It's true.
I can even swear on it.
So, please.
Just let it end.
Just let me climax one more time.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
*twitch*...
Chihiro: "Hic..."
The sensation of every pore on my body opening.
Goosebumps rise due to the different sensation from before.
*twitch*... *twitch*... *stop*...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Huh?
Did I climax?
...
No.
Not yet.
I probably haven't cummed yet.
For a moment, it felt like time had stopped.
The noise disappeared.
Surprisingly, even the inside of my body is quiet.
It feels like deep snow is falling only on me.
Chihiro: "...?"
A strange, wet sound from behind me.
I understand.
Chief is playing with his penis.
But it's strange.
Why is he doing it himself?
The person he wants to torment is right next to him.
If he wanted to, he could force himself upon her.
...
It doesn't matter anymore.
There's no need to know the reason.
Either way, this is the end.
We won't see each other again.
I was worried about what would happen after.
But we won't even talk on the phone anymore.
So even if I climax with all my might, I won't be made fun of.
No matter how disheveled I become, I won't be blamed.
All I have to do is return to my old life.
That's right, isn't it?
That's all I need, right?
*twitch*
Chihiro: "Ah..."
It's coming.
Something's coming.
Please.
Someone, anyone.
Tell me my thoughts aren't wrong.
*twitch!!*
Chihiro: "Haaaaa... ah... ah..."
*twitch, twitch, twitch, squeeze... twitch!!*
Chihiro: "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!"
*squeeze... squeeze... squeeze... squeeze... squeeze... ah!!*
Chihiro: "Noooooo... aah... ah... ah...!!"
Something exploded.
An overwhelming sense of climax.
The pleasure I felt until now seems like a tiny speck.
Biting my tongue harder to avoid fainting.
But there's nothing I can do about the whiteness in my head.
Everything is now beyond my control.
My sobs.
My body.
Even my thoughts.
Anger and hatred evaporate in pleasure.
I am consumed by an inexplicable euphoria.
It feels good.
Unbelievably good.
In this state, I come again.
Again and again, like waves.
*Intimate noises*
Chihiro: "Ah... no... stop... ah... ah... ah...!!"
This is bad.
I'm such a fool.
I can't accept this.
I won't be myself anymore.
Even when it's over, I won't be able to return to my original life.
I want to go home.
To the gentle arms of Sho-chan.
I'm willing to sacrifice anything for that.
Even if it means throwing away all my pride, I don't care.
*Squishing noises*
Chihiro: "No... please... I can't... ah..."
*Startling noises*
Chihiro: "Uh... ah... haa... ah... Sho-chan... I... ah... haa... haa... ah... ah... stop... ah..."
Yusaku: "Will you admit that you came from my tongue?"
*Squishing noises*
Chihiro: "Ah... yes... I admit... so please... stop..."
Yusaku: "How many times did you come?"
Chihiro: "I... I didn't count..."
*Intimate noises*
Chihiro: "Hii... I came... three times..."
Yusaku: "How did it feel?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Don't stutter. Speak clearly."
*Squishing noise*
Chihiro: "!"
*Startling noises*
Chihiro: "Hii... ah..."
Yusaku: "It felt good, didn't it?"
Chihiro: "Yes."
Yusaku: "Then express your gratitude sincerely. Of course, for each time you came."
Chihiro: "Uu... haa... uu..."
Yusaku: "What's the matter?"
*Intimate noises*
Chihiro: "No... ah... please... stop..."
*Squishing noises*
Chihiro: "Ah... ah... I'm going to lose control... there... stop..."
Yusaku: "... Your little clitoris has become so big."
Chihiro: "Ah... hii... haa... haa... uuu..."
*Chirping noise*
Chihiro: "Hii... I'll... I'll say it..."
*Chirping noises*
Chihiro: "Ah... ah... no more... ah..."
Yusaku: "Say, 'Thank you for licking my pussy.'"
Chihiro: "No... no way..."
Yusaku: "Hurry up and say it."
*Intimate noises*
Chihiro: "Hyaa..."
*Intimate noises*
Chihiro: "Ah... don't suck... ah... haa... haa..."
*Squishing noises*
Chihiro: "Hiccc..."
Yusaku: "... You're trying hard, aren't you?"
*Squishing noises*
Chihiro: "Ah... ah... ah... it's... coming again..."
Yusaku: "You seem to dislike four-letter words a lot."
Chihiro: "Ah... haa... haa... haa... ah..."
Yusaku: "... Look."
*Intimate noises*
Chihiro: "Stop... please... haa... haa... I can't... ah... ugh... I don't... want to come... anymore..."
*Squishing noise*
Chihiro: "Ah~... no... no way..."
*Shaking noises*
Chihiro: "Ah, I'm... coming while I'm still coming... it's been like this... since earlier... haa... haa... haa... ah..."
Yusaku: "That's interesting."
Chihiro: "It's... not... fun... at all..."
*Startling noise*
Chihiro: "Ah..."
*Shaking noises*
Chihiro: "Ah... it's coming... I'm... coming... let me rest... even if it's just a little... please... ah... ah... ah... ah..."
Yusaku: "Your gratitude to me comes before your own requests."
Chihiro: "Ah... ah..."
Yusaku: "Well, it's your choice what to do."
Chihiro: "Pu... O..."
Yusaku: "O?"
Chihiro: "O... Oma..."
*Intimate noise*
Yusaku: "Continue..."
Chihiro: "... Thank you for licking... my pu..."
Thank you very much.
Yusaku: "You stuttered. Start over."
Chihiro: "Thank you... for licking... my pussy."
Yusaku: "First time."
Chihiro: "Thank you... for licking... my pussy."
Yusaku: "Second time."
Chihiro: "Thank you for licking... my... hik... pussy... guz... hii..."
Yusaku: "... Madam."
*Squishing noises... startling noises!!*
Chihiro: "Hii... ah..."
Yusaku: "Ah, you're the best..."
*Squishing noises!!*
Yusaku: "Ah... haa..."
*Squishing noises*
Chihiro: "Haa... hm... hm... p... uh..."
The semen that spurted out like an arrow.
It fittingly flew into the air with a sense of accomplishment.
And like rain, it poured down on Chihiro's face.
The wife, not even having the time to wipe the semen dripping from her face.
Her body ached from saying the four-letter word for the first time.
The pleasure that was being constantly given, was pushing her to even greater heights.
Yes.
This was torture that surpassed an orgasm.
Yusaku: "Huff... ugh..."
Chihiro: "H... ugh..."
That's why it's engraved in her body.
The stained brand that will never disappear.
She should remember it every time something happens.
Of course, when she faces me.
Even when her beloved husband is in front of her.
This is a complete goodbye.
From the neat and cute Chihiro, who was only for Sho.
*Squishing noises*
Chihiro: "No more... ahh..."
*Squishing noises*
Chihiro: "Ah... ah... I... I gathered my courage to say it... hik... ahh... liar..."
Yusaku: "You didn't ask for anything after you said it."
Chihiro: "S... stop... stop moving your tongue... please..."
Yusaku: "I'm still thirsty."
Chihiro: "I'm... I'm coming again... I don't want to come anymore..."
Yusaku: "If you ask politely, I might consider it."
Chihiro: "I... I'll do... I'll ask... politely..."
Yusaku: "Please don't slurp my pussy. Please, I beg you, Chief Kazama..."
*Squishing noises*
*Startling noise*
Chihiro: "H... ah..."
*Shaking noises*
Chihiro: "Ah... no... no way..."
Yusaku: "I won't stop unless you say it."
Chihiro: "M... my... pu..."
*Shaking noises... startling noise*
Chihiro: "... slur... don't..."
*Shaking noises*
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "You didn't finish, so start over."
Chihiro: "... I... I'm fine."
Yusaku: "What?"
Chihiro: "I... won't... make it..."
*Squishing noise*
Chihiro: "I'm... coming..."
*Vibrating noises*
Yusaku: "Oops..."
*Dripping noises*
Chihiro: "No... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah..."
Yusaku: "Phew... this... is amazing... gulp... hm... gulp... gulp..."
Chihiro: "Pee... ah... ah... I'm... I'm coming... no, it's pee... stop... ah... ah... amazing... I, I'm coming..."
*Dripping noises... shaking... shaking... startling... noise...*
Chihiro: "...uh..."
*Shaking, shaking, shaking... startling... shaking...*
Chihiro: "Aaaaaaaaaah!!"
*Shaking noises*
Chihiro: "Hiiiii... ah... haha... ah... ah... help... I'm falling... ah... oh... ah... ah... ah, ah... ah..."
*Gushing noises*
Chihiro: "Haaaaah... hmm... hah... hah... ah... ah... uh..."
*Dripping noises... rushing... ah... ah... ah...*
Yusaku: "Ng... hm... gulp... hm... hm... hm..."
Chihiro: "Pee... it won't stop... embarrassing... ah... hah... hah... this is... not good... ah..."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Did you wash off the semen in your hair properly?"
Chihiro: "U... kuh..."
Yusaku: "Mine is thick, so it might leave a smell."
Chihiro: "E, enough... just get out."
Yusaku: "Suddenly being so bold."
Chihiro: "Just go home, please."
Yusaku: "Don't be so disdainful."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "As promised, I deleted the photos."
Chihiro: "Th, that's the least you could do."
Yusaku: "And I even helped clean up the wet floor."
Chihiro: "So, what do you want?"
Yusaku: "I can be kind too, can't I... right?"
Chihiro: "Wh, whose fault do you think it was..."
Yusaku: "...The fault of the lewd wife."
Chihiro: "U..."
Yusaku: "You peed yourself because it felt so good, right?"
Chihiro: "...Go home."
Yusaku: "It was pretty smelly."
Chihiro: "You, you pervert."
Yusaku: "So, you're the lewd one here, huh?"
Chihiro: "I, I never want to see your face again. Please leave."
Yusaku: "If that's what you want, Mrs."
Chihiro: "I, I've already told you that."
Yusaku: "...I think you're the one who's going to have trouble."
Chihiro: "Do you think I like you or something?"
Yusaku: "Hehe..."
Chihiro: "...Disgusting laugh."
Yusaku: "Is that your comeback to my self-flattering comment?"
Chihiro: "...Not really."
Yusaku: "Well, you should do as you like, Mrs. But if you change your mind, it might be too late."
Chihiro: "What do you mean?"
Yusaku: "Who knows..."
Chihiro: "I won't be intimidated by your empty threats anymore."
Yusaku: "...You'll find out soon whether they're just threats."
Chihiro: "You... you have a copy of the photo at your house, don't you?"
Yusaku: "Didn't I say it's only in my phone?"
Chihiro: "Then, then..."
Yusaku: "There's no need to have a long conversation with a man whose face you don't want to see. So, Mrs., I wish you and your beloved husband a lifetime of happiness."
Chihiro: "Wait a minute..."
Yusaku: "..."
It's always good, no matter how many times I experience it.
Being chased by a woman from behind.
Chihiro: "Speak clearly."
Yusaku: "Why do I need to do that?"
Chihiro: "Because you... you're being ambiguous..."
Yusaku: "Regardless of what you're told, you don't have to submit."
Chihiro: "..."
I turned my back and sat down at the entrance.
I'm deliberately tying my shoelaces slowly.
Chihiro: "Let me... let me check your phone again."
Yusaku: "Sure."
Finally, it's time.
Time to show off my latest work.
The particular image is already set.
Without turning around, I show her over my shoulder.
Yusaku: "Here."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Of course, only for an instant.
I intentionally make it ambiguous and quickly put it back in my pocket.
Chihiro: "Was that... me just now...?"
Yusaku: "Who knows..."
Chihiro: "..."
Her breath is shaking.
If I turn around, I'll see her.
But I'm holding back.
Right now, it's fun to imagine what's going on in her mind.
Are her flushed cheeks already turning pale?
Is she making an even more tearful face than before?
Chihiro: "Show me again, please."
Yusaku: "Whoops..."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
She's rough.
Chihiro, reaching over my shoulder...
She pushes her large breasts against my back again and again.
Each time, they bounce.
Chihiro: "Show me."
Yusaku: "Geez..."
I act as if I'm really annoyed.
I brush off Chihiro's hand like I'm shooing away a fly.
Yusaku: "A woman who has cut ties doesn't have that right."
Chihiro: "Until you leave the room, I do."
Yusaku: "Ah, I see."
*Squeeze*
Chihiro: "!!"
Yusaku: "So, do I still have the right to do this?"
While protecting the phone, I reached back with my free hand.
I found its location and grabbed her breast.
But Chihiro only flinched for a moment.
She's determined to not care about the groping hand.
I understand.
This is a life-or-death matter for you.
Chihiro: "I won't go home until you show me."
Yusaku: "I'm delighted you're insisting on staying."
Chihiro: "You, you coward."
Yusaku: "That's not a phrase I'd expect from you."
Thud.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
My elbow digs into her solar plexus.
Of course, it's just enough force to make her breathless.
But the effect is sufficient.
I can hear her groaning in discomfort.
Yusaku: "Your image will be ruined if you use harsh words."
Chihiro: "Sh... show... me..."
Yusaku: "I'll give you a hint, that's all."
Chihiro: "Ah... ah..."
Yusaku: "Infirmary, fainting, alone together, frog, pussy..."
Damn...
I'm about to laugh. My shoulders are shaking.
Yusaku: "How you interpret that is up to you, ma'am. If you want to retract the severance, make sure to pack a lunch for your husband as an apology."
Yusaku: "Of course, it needs to be more gorgeous than his. If his omelette has two slices, yours should have three plus love... got it?"
Chihiro: "Ah... ah..."
Chihiro's presence is fading.
She's probably crawling away like an earthworm.
All that's left is for her to cry out her misery.
Indeed, I can hear her sobbing from the kitchen area.
Yusaku: "Hmph..."
I'm done pretending to tie my shoelaces.
I grab my bag and stand up triumphantly.
I'm looking forward to it...
My first lovingly prepared lunch box from Madam.
Crack!!
Yusaku: "!?"
What the...?
That hurts.
I feel an intense burning pain in my back.
Before I can turn around...
I fall forward.
Yusaku: "Ah..."
Why am I face down?
Why are there shoes in front of me?
Is this warm feeling blood?
I'm confused by this sudden event.
I finally understood the situation.
This is bad.
That stupid woman.
To make me taste the dust of the entrance, she's got some guts.
I won't let this go.
I'll spread her pussy to her belly button.
Yusaku: "Ah..."
I'm fully determined.
But I can't move my hands, feet, or even a finger.
I can only roll my eyes in frustration.
Damn it.
Where the hell did she go?
Is she looking down on me with a victorious face?
Yusaku: "...?"
The sound of breaking glass.
A crazed scream.
A dull thud.
And another scream...
It's different from the first, just a shrill shriek.
But it's quite distant.
Yusaku: "..."
I see.
So that's what this is about.
She was driven that far into a corner.
Yusaku: "Ah..."
No, that's not it.
It might have come to this because I failed to corner her.
The fear that even avoids death.
I was a fool for not giving her that.
Yusaku: "..."
Suddenly the light in front of my eyes goes out.
Like someone flipped a switch.
My mind seems clouded over.
Not just my vision, all my senses are closing down.
Well, it doesn't matter.
I'm not alone, right?
Isn't that right, madam?
Your large breasts.
Your pussy that looks tight at a glance.
There are still many things I want to do to you.
Indeed.
Even if you're gone, I won't let it end.
I'll let my big penis do the talking.
This time, I'll torment you plenty in the afterlife...
