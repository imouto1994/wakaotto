...Entertainment ends...
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "...What is it?"
Chihiro: "...Please go home."
Yusaku: "Don't be so cold."
Chihiro: "Please leave while my husband is in the shower."
Yusaku: "You could at least treat me to dinner, right?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Haha..."
4 pm.
A modest argument between me and Chihiro.
The lewd official is also pleased with the entertainment.
I returned here just about five minutes ago.
Of course, it's not over yet.
While Chihiro is changing clothes in the back room.
I cleverly send the foolish husband to the bathroom with my words.
In other words, we are alone now.
No wonder the wife looks upset.
Chihiro: "Are you... going to do something else?"
Yusaku: "We'll just have a pleasant meal while talking about today's events. We are comrades who cooperated in entertaining, aren't we... right?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "If you wish, I can bring up your active part in the conversation."
Chihiro: "No, stop."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "Oops..."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Your phone is dancing on the table."
Chihiro: "...You can ignore it."
Yusaku: "Another love call from the lewd official?"
Chihiro: "Probably."
Yusaku: "Impressive, considering we just said goodbye."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "Answer it."
Chihiro: "There's nothing to talk about."
Yusaku: "Even though he gave you his number?"
Chihiro: "No, I didn't give it. When he gave his own number, he just took my phone..."
Suddenly.
Yusaku: "Oh."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "He'll probably call back soon."
Chihiro: "...What should I do?"
Yusaku: "About what?"
Chihiro: "..."
Chihiro looks serious.
She's really asking me for advice.
Chihiro: "It's not irrelevant to my husband's work, but on the other hand, I don't want to get involved anymore..."
Yusaku: "Hmm..."
Ignore him
Just go along with him
Yusaku: "Just ignore him."
Chihiro: "But he seems very persistent..."
Yusaku: "It's fine. The problem is this..."
Yusaku: "Just go along with him."
Chihiro: "Please don't say something impossible."
Yusaku: "Don't like that type?"
Chihiro: "I'm not so much averse to him as I find him difficult."
Yusaku: "You're careful with your words, aren't you..."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "You could clearly say you hate him."
Chihiro: "I, I'm not really..."
Yusaku: "You don't need to worry about the lewd official. The real problem is here..."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "Hehe..."
I pull out my phone from my breast pocket.
Like Pavlov's dog, the lady's face stiffens.
Bingo.
Her fear won't end in vain.
Yusaku: "The pee movie behind the toilet."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "Aren't you going to watch?"
Chihiro: "...I don't want to see."
Yusaku: "Even though I went to the trouble of filming it."
Chihiro: "...You're doing something terrible."
Yusaku: "You're not freaking out this time."
Chihiro: "I thought something was happening."
Yusaku: "Really..."
Chihiro: "Please, delete it."
Yusaku: "You're the one who knows best how meaningless those words are."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "You're leaking more than I thought. So much it can't all fit from the start to the finish."
Chihiro: "I don't want to hear such an explanation."
Yusaku: "You think I'll threaten you with this again, don't you?"
Chihiro: "It would be strange not to think that."
Yusaku: "Too bad."
I deliberately show the screen of my phone to Chihiro.
Chihiro: "Ah... no..."
Yusaku: "The one I'm threatening isn't you, it's that lewd official. Your spread-eagle photo is enough for you, so I'll delete this one once it has served its purpose."
Chihiro: "What do you plan to do with that?"
Yusaku: "Of course, I'm going to send an email. That'll scare him, and he won't call again... Aren't you happy?"
Chihiro: "Please, stop it."
Yusaku: "Why?"
Chihiro: "I... I don't want anyone to see that."
Yusaku: "He's also involved, so it's okay, isn't it?"
Chihiro: "I will answer his calls. Even if he's persistent, I will endure."
Yusaku: "That's not how it works."
Chihiro: "...You have another reason, don't you?"
Yusaku: "There's something I really want to report to the Debt Bureau. The one who brought in the fuss was that stupid lewd official."
Chihiro: "To use me to that extent..."
Yusaku: "...Finally feeling like panicking, huh?"
Chihiro: "Please, just don't send the email. It's enough that only you have such a thing."
Yusaku: "..."
I like that.
Not 'stop', but 'allow'.
I like those words.
Yusaku: "...What else do you suggest?"
Chihiro: "Even if you tell me to do something else..."
Yusaku: "If I threaten him in person, it will be exposed."
Chihiro: "Even if you send it by email, it's bound to be exposed."
Yusaku: "I'll disguise the sender as unknown. When doing something like this, even if it's just a pretense, it's polite to make sure it can't be traced back."
Yusaku: "If I attach the matter I want to report, there's no problem even if the sender is unknown. After that, it's just a matter of making sure we don't dig our own graves."
Chihiro: "You make me entertain him and use me as you please..."
Yusaku: "Having your breasts groped, jerking him off, and wetting yourself... right?"
Chihiro: "I, I didn't enjoy it. I didn't want to do it."
Yusaku: "So you deliberately didn't wear that swimsuit because you wanted to complain to me, right?"
Chihiro: "Please, enough..."
Yusaku: "You should have expected what I would do if you broke our agreement."
Chihiro: "Even if I had worn that ridiculous swimsuit... I'm sure I would have been made to do the same thing."
Yusaku: "...Maybe."
Chihiro: "So, it's just as I thought, isn't it?"
Yusaku: "Idiot."
Chihiro: "I, I'm an idiot anyway."
Yusaku: "The result would have been the same if you hadn't run away."
Chihiro: "What?"
Yusaku: "When you were being led away, you didn't resist."
Chihiro: "You told me not to resist..."
Yusaku: "Why do you only obey that part?"
Chihiro: "Because... the poster... and other things..."
Yusaku: "Tell me honestly."
Chihiro: "About what?"
Yusaku: "You really wanted to flirt with the lewd official."
Chihiro: "Please, don't say ridiculous things."
Yusaku: "Why didn't you scream while you were being led away?"
Chihiro: "No matter how much I asked for help, you ignored me. Screaming wouldn't have done anything."
Yusaku: "There were plenty of other people besides me."
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "You're good at acting."
Chihiro: "S-stop it."
Yusaku: "It's a shame I couldn't get you to have sex."
Chihiro: "S-stop it, stop it..."
Yusaku: "You shouldn't have pretended to throw the ring. You never intended to resist seriously."
Chihiro: "N-no, that's not true..."
Yusaku: "Now I finally understand why your pussy was wet."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "That's why you felt good so quickly. You even came three times, lying that you didn't want to..."
Chihiro: "*sobs*..."
Yusaku: "..."
Chihiro is covering her face and crouching down.
She is desperately trying to suppress her crying so that her beloved Shou doesn't hear.
The attractive figure she makes, curled up small.
I want to bind her with rope in that state and torment her.
The stench of masochism is seeping out so strongly that's what I think.
Amazing, madam.
You've grown more since being toyed with by the perverted official.
Yusaku: "...Your husband's about to get out of the shower."
Chihiro: "*sobs*... No more... Erase the... video... *sobs*... Ah... *sobs*..."
Chihiro: "I'm not... a slut... *sobs*... I really didn't want it... *sobs*... Hic... *sobs*... Ugh... *sobs*..."
Yusaku: "I got it, I got it."
Chihiro: "You don't get it... *sobs*... Ugh..."
Yusaku: "I said I got it, didn't I?"
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
I reach my arm under Chihiro's arm.
I forcibly lift up her curled up body.
Chihiro: "*sobs*... Ugh..."
Yusaku: "I'll erase the video."
Chihiro: "Hic... *sobs*... Ugh..."
Yusaku: "This isn't material for threats, consider it my goodwill."
Chihiro: "Is that... true?"
Yusaku: "I may not look it, but I'm not the type to mix business with pleasure."
I put my finger on the phone's button.
Chihiro waits with a tear-streaked face for it to be pressed.
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "..."
Chihiro: "...?"
Yusaku: "Phew..."
Chihiro: "Wh-what about the button?"
Yusaku: "It's hot, isn't it?"
Chihiro: "Wha... what...?"
Yusaku: "You're going shopping for dinner after this, right?"
Chihiro: "Y-yes, I will."
Yusaku: "That's why I think it's hot in that outfit."
Chihiro: "I-I'm not particularly hot."
Yusaku: "Hmm..."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Do you always go out with your apron on?"
Chihiro: "It's just around the neighborhood, so I keep it on."
Yusaku: "Hmm."
Yusaku's face looks noticeably dissatisfied.
Chihiro: "..."
Her face grows even more dissatisfied.
Chihiro: "Ugh... Ugh..."
Her face looks incredibly dissatisfied.
Chihiro: "Ah... Ah..."
Chihiro quickly heads to the kitchen.
While paying attention to the sound from the washroom, she hangs her apron next to the sink.
Chihiro: "...I've taken it off."
Yusaku: "..."
Chihiro: "Please, push the button quickly."
Yusaku: "It really is hot today."
Chihiro: "Do... Do you need something else...?"
Yusaku: "..."
Again, Yusaku's face looks dissatisfied.
Chihiro: "Eh..."
Her face becomes even more dissatisfied.
Chihiro: "Ah... Ah..."
Her face looks incredibly dissatisfied.
Chihiro: "You're... You're mixing personal and professional matters."
Yusaku: "How so?"
Chihiro: "You're threatening me."
Yusaku: "I didn't order anything."
Chihiro: "I can't go shopping in my underwear."
Yusaku: "Who said that?"
His gaze now falls on her ample chest.
It's meaningfully tracing the line of her see-through bra.
Chihiro: "You... You can't be serious..."
Yusaku: "...It's hot, isn't it?"
Chihiro: "Hig... gu..."
Chihiro looks distressed.
But she wipes away her tears.
She sighs sorrowfully.
She then starts to move uneasily with her back towards him.
She skillfully starts to remove the shoulder straps without taking off the dress.
The freed flesh doesn't sag but proudly maintains its position.
The shape of her breasts is clearly visible.
Any man passing by would hesitate to look directly at them.
*Bounce*...
Chihiro: "Are... Are you satisfied now?"
Yusaku: "..."
Chihiro: "So, please stop this now."
Yusaku: "Matching underwear, top and bottom, is the best, right?"
Chihiro: "...Usually, yes."
Yusaku: "What about now?"
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "Half-measures are not good, you know."
He now stares at her lower abdomen.
His eyes unblinkingly fixed on her crotch.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Once again, Chihiro turns her back.
Perhaps she's given up, she's not even concerned about the disarray of her skirt.
How sensual.
Her bare buttocks are almost visible.
Chihiro: "I... I have nothing left to take off."
Yusaku: "Hand me those panties."
Chihiro: "Eh..."
Chihiro's fingertips tremble.
The sight of her offering them up was indescribably magnificent.
That's why I intentionally played hard to get.
I stared at the freshly removed fabric.
I didn't accept them right away.
Chihiro: "Hurry…"
Yusaku: "…Alright, alright."
Beep.
As I tightly gripped the underwear.
I press the button on my phone, as promised.
Yusaku: "Well, off you go."
Chihiro: "Ugh…"
Yusaku: "Before that…"
I fumbled in my pocket.
What I handed her was about ten thousand
Chihiro: "...What is this?"
Yusaku: "Take this and buy as much beer as you can carry."
Chihiro: "...I can’t accept this money."
Yusaku: "I’ll just take you home with me, then."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "And don’t you dare buy any underwear from the convenience store."
Chihiro: "I-I understand."
Yusaku: "..."
That’s settled.
The sleazy official can be dealt with later.
After all, I’ve already gotten some skinship out of this.
And if needed, I can subtly imply things with my silver tongue.
Right now, the priority is the wife.
In just a few hours, it’ll be our wedding ceremony, after all.
Chihiro, heading out shopping without wearing any underwear...
She will soon learn what it means to be a bride.
Let her squirm as the cool breeze grazes her chest and thighs.
...
Shota: "Phew..."
Yusaku: "Yo."
Shota: "Pardon me for finishing ahead of you."
Yusaku: "...That was quite the long soak."
Shota: "At first, I planned to just take a quick shower, but I couldn’t resist..."
Yusaku: "Trying to relax and soothe your tired body, huh?"
Shota: "Why don’t you take a turn, too? I made sure to drain and refill the water."
Yusaku: "I’ll take your offer in spirit. My shoulders are sunburned, and they’re stinging like hell."
Shota: "Yeah, the weather was completely cloudless today."
While speaking, Akizuki glanced around the room.
His sunburned face turning from side to side.
Shota: "...Is Chihiro in the bathroom?"
Yusaku: "She’s out shopping."
Shota: "What—!?"
Yusaku: "There’s no need to be so surprised."
Shota: "I-I’m sorry for leaving her alone. I’ll make sure to remind Chihiro about this later."
Yusaku: "I encouraged her to go early. After soaking in the sun all day, don’t you think she’d be eager to get things done, just like the rest of us?"
Shota: "Huh?"
Yusaku: "Throat's parched, huh?"
Shota: "Well... yes..."
Yusaku: "Tonight's a celebration of the success of our entertainment. I think you did a great job dealing with the kid all day."
Shota: "Th-thank you."
Yusaku: "Even that nitpicky official seemed satisfied."
Shota: "Indeed, his attitude completely changed by the end. The guy who was scowling even asked for a handshake, saying, 'I'll remember your name.'"
Yusaku: "As I said, there's no harm done, right?"
Shota: "Yes, yes."
Yusaku: "Make sure to thank your wife, who became your conversation partner."
Shota: "I will, as soon as she gets back."
Yusaku: "She'll definitely be happy."
Tring, tring, tring...
Shota: "Ah..."
The ringing of the phone.
When I think about it, it's the first time I've heard it.
Shota: "Excuse me for a moment."
Yusaku: "..."
Everything is going according to plan.
Now, all that's left is to wait for Chihiro to return.
Of course, we'll toast before the sun sets.
This time, I'll be the one to entertain.
Chilled beer.
Fun conversations.
And suitable pills for our wedding night.
Shota: "Sec, Section Chief!"
Yusaku: "What?"
Shota, who's rushed over with a frantic look.
His lips were trembling like a zombie.
Yusaku: "What's wrong?"
Shota: "Chi, Chihiro... Police... Call..."
Yusaku: "Huh?"
Shota: "I'm going to the hospital."
Yusaku: "..."
Yusaku: "Hospital?"
What's going on?
What happened?
He dashed outside like a bullet.
No matter how much I looked around, I was the only one in the room.
It's like I was lying to myself a few seconds ago.
Why am I standing here in a daze?
Yusaku: "Damn..."
Unpleasant sweat seeping into my palm.
No matter how much I wiped, it wouldn't stop.
I tightly gripped Chihiro's underwear.
Trying not to acknowledge my own agitation.
Yusaku: "Hmph..."
I snorted as if to bluff.
And then I sat down heavily on the floor.
Enough with the bad jokes.
Even if you're trying to surprise me, this won't work.
I'm trying to shake off the bad feeling that won't go away.
I put my finger on the button of the cell phone I took out.
Chihiro Akizuki.
The registered name I gave her is Pochi.
Beep.
The continuous ringing of the call.
No matter how long I waited, it wouldn't stop.
This is ridiculous.
This can't be happening.
Even as I thought that, my fingers trembled minutely.
No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't stop them.
In that moment, my memory from a little while ago perfectly overlapped.
It's the same.
With her back then.
With Chihiro when she handed me her underwear.
I'm certain she, too, had her fingertips trembling like this...
...
......
.........
Shota: "Ah..."
In passing.
I lightly patted Akizuki's shoulder.
Everything is going according to plan.
Now, all that's left is to wait for Chihiro to return.
Of course, we'll toast before the sun sets.
This time, I'll be the one to entertain.
Chilled beer.
Fun conversations.
And using a suitable drug for our wedding night...
...
......
