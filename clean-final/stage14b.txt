Yusaku: "..."
Chihiro: "Um, good work today."
Yusaku: "It's nothing special."
Chihiro: "..."
The yakisoba is sold out.
Even before 8 PM.
An astonishing total of 550 servings sold.
In the end, we ran out of noodles to restock.
We proudly put up a 'Sold Out' sign.
The results perfectly matched Sho's words, that the section manager is a capable person.
I was a bit surprised to see a side of him I didn't know.
All that's left is to wait for the festival to end.
But I didn't feel like enjoying the other stalls.
So here I am, taking a breather behind the shrine, away from the hustle and bustle.
Chihiro: "*sigh*..."
A pleasant afterglow after getting totally engrossed.
Despite being so busy, I don't feel tired at all.
Maybe it's because everything went smoothly.
Of course, if I was alone, it would have been impossible...
Yusaku: "We won."
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Yusaku: "Against the HR department."
Chihiro: "Ah, right."
Yusaku: "Serves them right, they're always acting so high and mighty."
Chihiro: "..."
Words spat out in disdain.
He's been like this for a while.
Is he always like this at work?
Or maybe he just dislikes the people from HR.
But isn't his father the department head?
Chihiro: "Um..."
Yusaku: "What is it?"
Chihiro: "I heard from Sho the other day that..."
Yusaku: "..."
Chihiro: "..."
He glanced at me.
"Don't say anything unnecessary."
His eyes said as much.
But for some reason, I couldn't hold back.
I wanted to know what he was thinking so badly.
Chihiro: "Why... why did you choose to sell the same yakisoba?"
Yusaku: "What do you gain by asking that?"
Chihiro: "Ah, no, I was just wondering why..."
Suddenly.
Chihiro: "Kyah...!"
Yusaku: "Why do you wear that ribbon?"
Chihiro: "Ah...uh..."
My body stiffens.
But I can't resist.
Thanks to him, Sho and I were saved.
The fact hesitates me to act against his strong attitude.
It would be fair to offset this against his past treatment.
But I was awkwardly considering it separately.
Yusaku: "If you like it, you should wear it."
Chihiro: "Huh?"
What was he talking about?
Suddenly my feet were spread apart.
For a moment, my mind was blank.
The ribbon.
I'm pretty sure he mentioned that.
I'm surprised he remembered.
Back then, I was half-teasing.
It wasn't a big deal for the section manager.
Yusaku: "In a yukata, a ribbon on your head would be barely acceptable, even at your age."
Chihiro: "It's not a ribbon to put on my head... it's a ribbon I received during a sports festival..."
Yusaku: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "What the hell is that?"
Chihiro: "Um... well..."
I'm in trouble.
If I try to brush it off, he'll see right through me.
And then he'll scold me again.
Chihiro: "It's... it's a trivial reason but..."
I begin to talk as he asks.
My parents run a beauty salon.
So, during sports festivals and such, I was always alone.
But once when I was in the fourth grade.
The Sunday was rainy and it was postponed to Tuesday.
Both my parents were able to come watch me.
Of course, I was very excited.
But my athletic ability didn't keep up.
Even in the footrace, I was in fifth place until just before the goal.
The usual rank.
But then a miracle happened.
The top two runners tripped and fell.
Somehow, I ended up in third place.
Honestly, I was surprised myself.
The green ribbon I received for the first time.
No matter how faded it gets, I cherish it forever.
Yusaku: "I see..."
Chihiro: "..."
It's silly.
I talked in more detail than necessary.
But thanks to that, I feel refreshed.
I feel like the air inside my heart has cleared.
On the other hand, he seems really bored listening.
He was even picking his nose because of the sheer boredom.
It doesn't matter.
What he thinks doesn't change my precious memory.
That ribbon is still my treasure.
Chihiro: "Wha... what about you, Section Manager?"
Yusaku: "What?"
Chihiro: "About the yakisoba I asked earlier..."
Suddenly.
Chihiro: "Ah!!"
Yusaku: "We didn't make a promise to answer each other in turn, did we?"
Chihiro: "Uh... ah..."
Yusaku: "Did we?"
Chihiro: "We... didn't..."
Yusaku: "Then apologize."
Chihiro: "...I'm... sorry..."
A sound...
Chihiro: "Mmm... no... there are people... nearby..."
Yusaku: "If you want to know that badly, I'll tell you."
A sound... a sound...
Chihiro: "Ah... ah... ah..."
Yusaku: "The reason was that I didn't want to lose."
A sound...
Chihiro: "Ah... ah... ah..."
Yusaku: "That's all there is to it."
A sound... a sound...
Chihiro: "Yo...your fingers are inside me..."
A sound... a sound... a sound...
Chihiro: "No... stop..."
He ignores my words as usual.
The devil's fingers dive into my vagina on their own.
He starts to rub my clitoris with his thumb.
A sound... a sound... a sensation...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
No.
He needs to stop touching me.
I shouldn't allow this.
Despite these thoughts, my body feels limp.
I can't reach the point where I can resist.
I'm preoccupied with trying not to let out a lewd voice.
A sensation... a sound... a sensation... a sound... a sound...
Chihiro: "Ah...uh...ah...ah...no...not there..."
Yusaku: "...Now it's my turn to ask a question."
A sudden sensation.
Chihiro: "Ah...!"
Yusaku: "...Your answer?"
Chihiro: "Yes...!"
Yusaku: "Your slow running was because of your breasts, wasn't it?"
A sensation, a sensation...
Chihiro: "Please, don't... touch me there..."
A bad feeling.
The conversation is going in a strange direction.
Yusaku: "You couldn't run properly because you were worried about them bouncing around... am I wrong?"
Chihiro: "At that time, they weren't that big."
Yusaku: "Not that big, how big then?"
Chihiro: "Ah...ah..."
Yusaku: "...Answer."
Chihiro: "Probably about... 75 centimeters..."
Yusaku: "That's plenty big enough to bounce."
A sound... a wet sound...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
It must be because of his mean questions.
The lewd noises are getting louder.
Yusaku: "But you were wearing a bra, weren't you?"
Chihiro: "Well, I wasn't... during the sports festival..."
Yusaku: "Considering that you dislike standing out..."
A sound...
Chihiro: "Ugh...ah..."
Yusaku: "...You were quite defenseless, weren't you?"
Chihiro: "But..."
Yusaku: "Did you want everyone to see?"
Chihiro: "No, that's not it."
Yusaku: "Be honest."
Chihiro: "I hated the fact that mine were the only big ones. But they were growing on their own and my mother said it was still okay..."
Yusaku: "So you had no choice but to let your breasts bounce."
Chihiro: "After the sports festival ended, the teacher warned me... From then on, I started wearing proper underwear..."
Yusaku: "Hmm..."
A squishing sound.
Chihiro: "Ah...ah..."
Yusaku: "What did you call your teacher?"
Chihiro: "Just... 'teacher'..."
Yusaku: "Didn't you jokingly call him 'uncle' or something?"
Chihiro: "Ah..."
A jolt.
Chihiro: "No... stop..."
Yusaku: "What?"
Chihiro: "That... word... no..."
Yusaku: "Why?"
Chihiro: "I can't say 'uncle'..."
Yusaku: "...So it was the teacher after all."
Chihiro: "I don't... call the teacher like that."
Yusaku: "So who's the 'uncle' then?"
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "Was it some old man who lived nearby..."
Chihiro: "Hmm..."
That's not it.
But I don't want to tell the truth.
If I do, I'll be scolded.
I'm sure I'll be made to feel embarrassed again.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Who exactly?
I haven't met him since that time.
I refuse to go even to memorial services.
Of course, I didn't invite him to my wedding.
Now, I can barely remember his face.
But the fear hasn't disappeared.
I'm keeping my promise to never tell anyone, no matter what happens.
Yusaku: "...Answer me."
Chihiro: "!!"
He turns my body around.
And keeps my legs spread.
Chihiro: "Wait a minute, please."
Yusaku: "...For what?"
Chihiro: "Ah..."
My underwear is flipped over.
I feel the air directly touch my important part.
But it's only cold at first.
Before I know it, there's a hot, hard lump between my thighs.
The devil pushes his penis against me without any hesitation.
Chihiro: "You can't... put it in."
There are many people on the other side of the shrine.
It's unthinkable to have sex in a place like this.
A forceful push.
Chihiro: "~~~~~!!"
The stupid manager.
He's really trying to put it in.
Yet I can't resist effectively.
I'm just wriggling my hands and feet like a bug pinned down.
Chihiro: "You've already accomplished your purpose of raping me."
Yusaku: "Didn't I tell you before?"
Yusaku: "So what?"
A harsh push.
Chihiro: "~~~!!"
Yusaku: "I want to know more about you."
Chihiro: "That's... a lie."
After raping me, he shows no interest.
Who was the one who completely ignored me?
Chihiro: "Let me... go home as I am."
Yusaku: "If you think so, why don't you run away?"
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "There's no more blackmail material, right?"
Chihiro: "...There's... none..."
Yusaku: "Then, run away."
Chihiro: "Ah... ah..."
Yusaku: "If you stay still, it'll go in all the way."
Chihiro: "You... You saved Shou-chan and me..."
Yusaku: "That's news to me."
Chihiro: "Do you think I could resist in such a situation?"
Yusaku: "That's how you always deceive yourself."
Chihiro: "Ah... hii..."
Yusaku: "The real reason isn't like that, is it?"
Chihiro: "Aa... ah... ah... ah..."
Yusaku: "Admit you want to be tormented."
Chihiro: "I... I don't want to be tormented."
Yusaku: "You feel anxious when I leave you alone, don't you?"
Chihiro: "Please don't say such strange things."
Yusaku: "You're the one who became strange, not me."
Chihiro: "N-no... it's... it's entering..."
Yusaku: "Who was the one who got angry while being praised during the festival meeting with your husband?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Who was the one who was crying for no reason at the bicycle parking lot?"
Chihiro: "That... that was..."
Yusaku: "If you can explain it, then try."
Chihiro: "Uu... sob... ah..."
Yusaku: "Hurry up."
Chihiro: "I... I don't remember anymore."
Yusaku: "Even though it happened last night?"
Chihiro: "You're too irresponsible, so I..."
Yusaku: "You wanted me to say some snide remark like always..."
Chihiro: "N-no, that's not it..."
Yusaku: "You wanted me to look at you with scorn like always..."
Chihiro: "That's not it...!"
Yusaku: "...But it is."
Chihiro: "Ah... ah... ah... ah... ah..."
Yusaku: "You should have a faint idea of why this is happening."
Chihiro: "I... I don't want to hear anymore...!"
Yusaku: "You love to blame yourself, don't you?"
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "You can't help but want to punish yourself. That's why you intentionally put yourself in painful situations, like jumping into fire."
Chihiro: "I... I don't do that."
Yusaku: "Well, it's not surprising you'd say that."
Chihiro: "Ah... ahh..."
Yusaku: "You're doing it unconsciously, just like how your body is reacting in such a strange way..."
Chihiro: "Ha... Ha... Ha... Ha..."
Yusaku: "...Why does this happen?"
Chihiro: "It's because... you torment me... I've become strange..."
Yusaku: "...Doubtful."
Chihiro: "Hii..."
Yusaku: "Your twisted mind isn't that simple."
Chihiro: "N-no... ah..."
Yusaku: "When did you start hating men's gazes?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Walking along the edge of the road, shrinking yourself, feeling guilty even in marital relations, always blaming yourself... Did this start when you met me?"
Chihiro: "Ah... ah... ah..."
Yusaku: "...It's not that, is it?"
Chihiro: "I... I am..."
Yusaku: "...Punishing yourself by blaming me."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "...You remember, don't you?"
Chihiro: "Ah... ah... ah... ah..."
I remembered. What happened afterward. My uncle who was staring at my underwear.
"Show me how you pee," he said in a gentle voice.
I obeyed, my face tense. If I resisted, I'd be locked up again. That's what I thought.
The sound of the shutter echoed in the barn. I didn't understand why. I just stared at the lens.
My legs were spread wider and wider. In the end, I was sitting with my legs straight out. It reminded me of a sumo wrestler's sitting posture. I remember thinking that as I endured.
Then my uncle kissed me. It was sudden, and I was very surprised. But I was scared, so I just stood still. Perhaps he was reassured by my attitude.
My uncle reached for my groin. His thick finger slipped into my underwear.
Chihiro: "Hii..."
Yes, I was touched in a sensitive area.
The smell of tobacco spreading in my mouth. Uncle's finger, more disgusting than that.
He didn't insert it into my vagina. But he persistently touched one particular area.
Five minutes. Ten minutes. Maybe more.
A strange sensation I had never known before. My belly was intensely itchy. The area further below was tingling.
I must have wanted to pee. The moment I thought so, I couldn't hold it anymore...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
No... I'm about to...
Right now... even though his penis isn't moving...
Yusaku: "Whoa... oh..."
Chihiro: "...I'm going... to cum..."
Yusaku: "...I don't mind."
Chihiro: "Even if it's just a little... please move... your penis..."
Yusaku: "Why?"
Chihiro trembles.
Chihiro: "It's embarrassing... to cum while staying still..."
Yusaku: "My penis is properly inside, right?"
Chihiro: "But... that's... not..."
Chihiro trembles intensely.
Chihiro: "Ah, ah~~, I won't... make... it..."
Chihiro convulses and trembles... a splash...
Chihiro: "...I'm... cumming... it's coming out..."
Splash, splash...
