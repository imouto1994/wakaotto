Chihiro: "Hiiii...n...no...ah..."
I'm finished.
He's penetrated me to the core.
This time, it's shockingly smooth compared to the first.
The only similarity is it getting stuck halfway.
I'm surprised at how little it hurts.
It must be because I'm incredibly wet.
If not that, then perhaps because of the different position.
Or maybe his penis isn't as large as usual.
Chihiro: "Kuh...haah..."
Another lie.
Just as he said earlier.
I'm always deceiving myself like this.
I've developed a habit of running away from things I don't want to admit.
In reality, it's very hard and big.
Even if it doesn't hurt much, the inside of my vagina feels full.
Even the entrance is being stretched wide open...
Chihiro: "Hii...gu...uh..."
Yusaku: "It's about time you were honest."
Chihiro: "No..."
Yusaku: "Why do you blame yourself?"
Chihiro: "I, I'm not really..."
Yusaku: "What's at the root of this?"
Chihiro: "I, I don't want to say."
Yusaku: "Is it because of your uncle?"
Chihiro: "!"
Startled.
Chihiro: "No...Uncle...No..."
Yusaku: "See..."
Chihiro: "P, please... stop..."
Yusaku: "Tell me who this uncle is."
Chihiro: "I, I don't know... I don't know..."
Yusaku: "...Your current state will give it away easily."
... The janitor uncle
... The passing by uncle
... The uncle who lived nearby
... The teacher from school, is he the uncle?
... The uncle in the family
Yusaku: "...The janitor uncle."
Yusaku: "...The passing by uncle."
Yusaku: "...The uncle who lived nearby."
Yusaku: "...The teacher from school, is he the uncle?"
Yusaku: "...The uncle in the family."
Chihiro: "Hii!!"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "...No response."
Chihiro: "Uh...ah..."
Yusaku: "...This is also no response."
Chihiro: "E, enough already..."
Yusaku: "...I don't want to stop."
Chihiro: "Uh..."
Chihiro: "...That's not it."
Yusaku: "Then..."
Startled.
Chihiro: "No... my vagina is... trembling on its own..."
Yusaku: "...Bingo."
Chihiro: "Aguh...haa...haa..."
Yusaku: "...Tell me what happened with the uncle in the family."
Chihiro: "I, I don't know... I can't... remember..."


Yusaku: "Are you planning to keep pretending, to keep coming to terms with your peculiar body and live on like that?"
Slurp.
Chihiro: "Ugh... Ah..."
Yusaku: "You don't want to live like that, do you?"
Slip... Slip... Slide... Slide...
Chihiro: "No... I can't... hold back... my voice..."
Yusaku: "...Just let it out."
Chihiro: "But... someone might hear us..."
Yusaku: "Isn't that a fitting situation for a wife who yearns for punishment?"
Chihiro: "I... I don't want others to see us... having sex."
Yusaku: "...I see."
Slide...
Chihiro: "Ah... ah..."
Yusaku: "But when you're actually put in that situation..."
Slide, slide...
Chihiro: "Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah...!"
Yusaku: "...You get so excited that you lose yourself, don't you?"
Chihiro: "I... I don't...!"
Yusaku: "The more unpleasant it is, the more your body aches for it."
Chihiro: "I... I'm just embarrassed... that's all..."
Yusaku: "That embarrassment is the cause of your excitement."
Slip... Slide... Slurp... Slip...
Chihiro: "Ah... Ah... Ah... No... Ah..."
Yusaku: "...What exactly was instilled in you?"
Chihiro: "Ah... Hah... Hah..."
Yusaku: "If you don't say it, you'll continue to suffer forever."
Slip... Slip... Slide... Slide...
Chihiro: "Hii... Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah..."
Yusaku: "You really want someone to save you, don't you..."
Slurp.
Chihiro: "My... clitoris... no... ah..."
Yusaku: "...You want me to save you. I'm the only savior you have."
Chihiro: "..."
A savior?
I don't know about that.
But the itchiness that I've been carrying over from yesterday has disappeared, almost unbelievably.
The same goes for the unpleasant feelings that were constantly there.
The yakisoba wasn't selling.
A demon suddenly appeared before me, who was feeling down.
"Hey, ugly."
With that one word, the fog in my mind cleared up strangely.
As if I had been reset, I stopped thinking about unnecessary things.
Why?
What am I longing for?
What's the real reason why I cried so much?
Am I unknowingly asking something from this person?
Slip... Slide... Slip... Slide...
Chihiro: "Ah... Ah... Ah... My voice... my voice... Ah..."
Yusaku: "I'll make you scream even louder."
Slide...
Chihiro: "No... no..."
Yusaku: "If it's no, then be honest and speak."
Slide... Push... Slide...


Chihiro: "Ah... ah..."
Yusaku: "Will you feel like confessing if I torment your womb?"
Chihiro: "Please... anything but that..."
I braced myself, trying to protect my baby.
But what scared me was just his words.
Perhaps because of our face-to-face position, he doesn't penetrate me very deeply.
His movements aren't that fast either.
He even gives me enough time to speak.
Slip... Slip... Slide... Squelch... Slip...
Chihiro: "Ah... ah... hah... hah... ah... ah..."
His penis moves in and out slowly.
Because I'm sitting upright, everything is in my line of sight.
This is the first time I've properly seen our joined parts.
I'm shocked by the grotesqueness of it, more than I imagined.
It feels like we're animals.
Sex isn't beautiful at all.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
It's a bit of a shock.
Because that filthiness overlaps with my current self.
It's like seeing a life-sized me, stripped of all pretenses.
The part of me that's being penetrated is exactly that.
Yes.
Even if I couldn't be sure, I had a faint feeling.
The notion that I couldn't compensate because I'm clumsy is a lie.
I think I actually desire to be in a vulnerable position.
As this man says, not consciously but unconsciously.
The fact that I didn't put the key in the mailbox was the same.
I'm sure I wasn't scared of it disappearing.
Suddenly the ladder was taken away.
I was scared of becoming unable to descend by myself.
The changed attitude of the section manager.
I want to confirm what he intends again.
So, I purposely created a chance to respond directly...
Slip... Slip... Slide... Slide...
Chihiro: "Ah... ah... hah... hah... ah... ah..."
I'll admit it now.
I can't stand against this man.
I love Sho-chan.
He's the person I love most in the world.
But nothing changes with just that.
Probably, I'll stay like this until I die.
The self-loathing I've been carrying with me all this time.
I feel like I could become a little easier if I could convey it to someone.
I'll speak up.
Just like when I talked about the ribbon earlier...
Chihiro: "During... the summer vacation..."
Yusaku: "...Summer vacation?"
Chihiro: "I was left... at my uncle's house..."
Throb.
Chihiro: "Ah... ah..."
I can't.
Just trying to talk about it makes my vagina shudder.
Please don't stop moving your penis.
It's embarrassing to pant on my own without being touched.
Yusaku: "...Continue."


Slip... Slip... Slip...
Chihiro: "Ah... Ah... In the countryside... where there were chickens..."
The past I'd been desperately trying to forget.
I talked about it, recalling each and every memory.
Avoiding the word 'uncle' as much as possible.
Focusing on the pressure of the penis more than my emotions.
The strange voice I heard in the hallway.
Peeking into my uncle's room through a hole in the sliding door.
Wetting the bed because I couldn't go to the toilet.
Being scolded by my uncle the next morning...
Throb.
Chihiro: "Ah... Ah... Hah... Hah..."
Yusaku: "...Then?"
Chihiro: "As punishment, I was locked in the barn."
Yusaku: "Hmm..."
Slip... Slip... Squelch... Drip...
Chihiro: "Ah... Ah... Hah... Ah... Ah... Ah..."
Yusaku: "After that?"
Chihiro: "Even though I cried and apologized, they didn't let me out. The smell of damp straw, it was pitch-dark even during the day... So, so, I was..."
Yusaku: "...You were?"
Chihiro: "I was... huddled in a corner, trembling."
Yusaku: "...Being alone in the dark is scary, isn't it?"
Slip... Slip... Slip...
Chihiro: "Ah... I was scared... very... ah... hah... hah..."
Yusaku: "But you were let out eventually, right?"
Chihiro: "About an hour later, the door opened... my uncle came in... but the outside light was so bright... so I couldn't see his face well..."
Chihiro: "When he got close, I could see him smiling... I thought he had forgiven me, so I held back my tears and smiled back..."
Yusaku: "...You've been ladylike since you were little."
Chihiro: "But then, even though he was smiling, he said in a very scary voice, 'Don't tell anyone about what you saw yesterday'..."
Throb.
Chihiro: "Ah... Ah..."
Yusaku: "Did your uncle stay standing?"
Chihiro: "He was crouching in front of me."
Yusaku: "What was he looking at when he was crouching?"
Chihiro: "Eek...!!"
Throb.
Chihiro: "Hi... Ah..."
Squeeze... Squeeze...
Chihiro: "Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah..."
Yusaku: "...Was he looking at your face?"
Chihiro: "Ah... Hah... Hah... Hah... Ah..."
Yusaku: "...Answer me."
Chihiro: "Not... not my face, but lower down..."
Throb... Ah...


Chihiro: "Hiii...ah..."
Yusaku: "What position were you in?"
Chihiro: "I... I kept hugging my knees..."
Yusaku: "Were you wearing trousers?"
Chihiro: "A... A pleated skirt..."
Chihiro, trembling: "Ah... hiii... ahh... uh..."
Not good. I can't look.
Yusaku: "So where was your uncle's gaze?"
Chihiro: "Inside my skirt... He was laughing while staring at my underwear..."
Chihiro, trembling: "No... so embarrassing... ah..."
Yusaku: "He did more than just look, didn't he?"
Chihiro: "I... I don't know..."
Yusaku: "Don't lie."
Chihiro: "Higuh... It's true... I don't remember..."
Yusaku: "The story doesn't end there, does it?"
Chihiro: "No... no... I can't stand it... I... I'm about to... ah..."
Yusaku: "What did your uncle do?"
Chihiro: "I... I don't know... But he had a camera..."
Yusaku: "A camera?"
Chihiro: "Hii... ah... ha... ah... ah..."
Yusaku: "...Roll back your memory."
Chihiro: "Haaa... ah... agu... ha... ah... ah..."
Yusaku: "Imagine yourself at that moment."
Chihiro: "Agu... ah... I... I'm coming... Section Chief... ah..."
Yusaku: "...I'm not the Section Chief, I'm your uncle."
Chihiro: "!!"
Chihiro, trembling: "You can't say things like that."
Chihiro: "You're different... you're the Section Chief... ah..."
Yusaku: "...Chihiro."
Chihiro: "Stop it..."
Yusaku: "You've grown a lot since I last saw you."
Chihiro: "...Hii... n-no... stop... I'm... I'm coming... ah..."
Yusaku: "...Don't tell anyone about yesterday."
Chihiro: "!!"
Chihiro: "Uuuu..."
Yusaku: "My penis feels that good, huh?"


Chihiro: "No... it's not like that... Uncle didn't... didn't put his... in..."
The sound of sudden silence: *Snap*.
