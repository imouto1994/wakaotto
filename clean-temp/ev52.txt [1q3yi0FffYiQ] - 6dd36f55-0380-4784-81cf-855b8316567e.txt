SLAP!! …Squish.
Chihiro: "Hyaa…ah…"
Yusaku: "…Answer."
Chihiro: "I…I'm making my pussy soaking wet."
Yusaku: "Yet, you still don't cover your breasts."
Chihiro: "I…I won't cover them."
Yusaku: "No more sneaking around the edges of the road."
Chihiro: "I'll walk properly in the middle…"
Yusaku: "How can you do that?"
Chihiro: "Uuu…"
SLAP!! …Squish.
Chihiro: "Hii…h…it hurts…"
Yusaku: "…How can you do that?"
Chihiro: "Because I'm a naughty woman."
Yusaku: "How naughty?"
Chihiro: "Even though I'm married, even though I'm pregnant…I've had a lot of sex with the manager…"
Yusaku: "Is it just sex?"
SLAP!! …Squish.
Chihiro: "Ah…"
Yusaku: "There must be something more extreme."
Chihiro: "I gave a blowjob next to Shou-chan."
Yusaku: "Is that all?"
Chihiro: "And…I played molester games on the train. I was surrounded by the usual people, and they fondled my breasts…"
Yusaku: "What else?"
Chihiro: "When Shou-chan was away on a business trip, I went to the manager's room…"
Yusaku: "…You're a bad wife to stay overnight."
Chihiro: "After cooking dinner, I was sent outside in my underwear, and no matter how much I rang the bell, he wouldn't let me in…I peed myself in front of the door…"
SLAP!! …Squish.
Chihiro: "Ugh…huu…"
Yusaku: "You didn't just pee."
Chihiro: "I…I came…just from being outside…I climaxed…"
Yusaku: "What was your husband doing at the time?"
Chihiro: "He was on a business trip…working…"
Yusaku: "And the wife?"
Chihiro: "Ah…uh…"
SLAP!! …Squish.
Chihiro: "Ah…ha…ah…"
Yusaku: "What was the wife doing?"
Chihiro: "I…I was being made to do naughty things…"
Yusaku: "You enjoyed being tormented, didn't you?"
Chihiro: "Yes, that's right."
Yusaku: "But the one you love is…"
Chihiro: "Shou-chan."
Yusaku: "The one you care about is…"
Chihiro: "Shou-chan."
Yusaku: "Then whose cock is precious?"
Chihiro: "Mmm…"
SLAP!! …Squish.
Chihiro: "Hi…gu…"
Yusaku: "If you don't answer, I'll squeeze your breasts."


Chihiro: "No, please... it hurts... please stop..."
Yusaku: "...Even though you really want this."
*Squeeze*
Chihiro: "Ah... ugh..."
Yusaku: "You want your swollen breasts to be squeezed."
*Squeeze, squeeze*
Chihiro: "Hii... ah..."
Yusaku: "That's why you purposely don't answer, right?"
Chihiro: "Haah... nn..."
*Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze*
Chihiro: "Haah... ah... nn... ah..."
Yusaku: "The air is filled to the brim, like a rubber ball's elasticity."
*Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze*
Chihiro: "You're... too strong."
*Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze*
Chihiro: "Hii... ah... ow... ah... no... again..."
Yusaku: "...Again?"
Chihiro: "It's... coming out."
Yusaku: "What is?"
Chihiro: "Breast milk... it's... coming out..."
Yusaku: "...Let it out."
Chihiro: "Nn..."
Yusaku: "I'll suck it out like last time."
*Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze*
*Squirt... squirt...*
Chihiro: "Ahh... it came out... my breast... it came out... ah..."
Yusaku: "Hmm... huff... uh..."
Chihiro: "Hi..."
*Suck, suck... suck...*
Chihiro: "No, you can't drink... you shouldn't... do that..."
Yusaku: "...You're saying something different from before."
Chihiro: "Th-that time I misspoke... the section chief scolded me..."
Yusaku: "What did you say again?"
Chihiro: "I... said you were cute... like a baby..."
*Suck... suck...*
Chihiro: "Haah... ah... nn..."
Yusaku: "You shouldn't call a grown man cute, right?"
Chihiro: "I... I'm sorry."
Yusaku: "You're just too maternal, that's your problem."
Chihiro: "I'm sorry... I'm sorry..."
Yusaku: "...And too lustful."
*Suck... suck... suck...*
Chihiro: "Ah... haah... ah..."
Yusaku: "Even though your husband is away on a business trip tonight..."
Chihiro: "If he wasn't, we couldn't meet like this."
Yusaku: "Exposing your pussy while he's away..."
*Squelch*
Chihiro: "Ah... ugh..."
Yusaku: "Having your protruding veins on your breasts squeezed..."
*Squeeze*
Chihiro: "Ahh... it's... coming out... again..."
*Squirt*
Chihiro: "Ah... ah..."
Yusaku: "I, your husband's boss, am sucking your breast milk."
Chihiro: "If it's the section chief that I respect, surely even Shō-chan would..."


Yusaku: "You idiot."
*Slurping sounds*
Chihiro: "Ah...hi..."
Yusaku: "Do you think you can be forgiven with that kind of logic?"
*Slurping sounds continue*
Chihiro: "Haah... ah... I'm going to come..."
*More slurping sounds*
Chihiro: "Just from having my breasts sucked, I'm going to come."
Yusaku: "...I won't let you come from just this."
Chihiro: "Then, put your penis in me."
Yusaku: "Didn't I say no?"
Chihiro: "Uuh..."
Yusaku: "You have to wait until the stable period."
Chihiro: "But that's still months away."
Yusaku: "Do you want me to do something about it?"
Chihiro: "...Yes."
Yusaku: "Then answer the question from before. Which penis do you like?"
Chihiro: "I... I like big penises."
Yusaku: "Between your husband's and mine, which do you prefer?"
Chihiro: "Nn..."
*Spank!!... bounce*
Chihiro: "Ah, ow."
Yusaku: "If you don't answer, I won't do anything about it."
Chihiro: "Please, just don't make me compare with Sho-chan."
Yusaku: "...It's not okay to compare with Sho-chan?"
*Spank!!... bounce*
Chihiro: "It...it hurts."
Yusaku: "Who said that before?"
Chihiro: "At that time, I just..."
*Spank!!... bounce*
Chihiro: "Hi...!"
Yusaku: "You're not so fond of drama that you'd lie while crying, right?"
*Spank!!... bounce*
Chihiro: "Aggh...haa...haa...ah..."
Yusaku: "...Tsk."
*Spank!!... bounce*
Chihiro: "Ah...ah..."
Yusaku: "When it comes to your husband, you're always like this."
*Spank!!... bounce*
Chihiro: "Hic...uh...ah...ah...ah..."
Yusaku: "...I was thinking of celebrating your birthday early."
Chihiro: "...Birthday...mine?"
Yusaku: "It's the day after tomorrow, right?"
Chihiro: "Y...yes."
Yusaku: "Happy birthday."
Chihiro: "Th...thank you."
Yusaku: "You want me to celebrate, right?"
Chihiro: "There's nothing special that I want..."
Yusaku: "Don't make a person's good intentions nothing."
Chihiro: "As long as I can be tormented like this sometimes, I am..."
Yusaku: "...You say such cute things."
*Spank!!... bounce*
Chihiro: "Ow... that hurts..."


Yusaku: "Given what you've just said, I'll relieve your discomfort."
Chihiro: "R-really?"
Yusaku: "I'll make you feel good to your heart's content. Of course, in my own special way."
