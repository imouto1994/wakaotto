...One month later...
Shota: "Chihiro, grab the duct tape."
Chihiro: "Okay."

It's a Sunday in late August.
The heat of summer still lingers.
Just a little movement causes sweat to break out.
Today, from morning, we've had the doors and windows wide open.
The dust is incredible; we can't possibly keep them closed.
We need to keep the place as ventilated as possible.
It's the day before we move.
I guess it's the same in any home.
I look around the room that's transformed.
It's been a quick yet seemingly long year and a half.
This place has become full of our memories.
But by tomorrow, we'll be saying goodbye to it.
Yusaku: "Hmm..."

In the end, we decided to move back to the countryside.
After that incident, Shota consulted with the deputy manager.
Because of the nature of the matter, it was kept hush-hush.
Section Chief Hazama denied everything as expected.
People who brazenly lie can truly be frightening.
In the end, they twisted it to say that I was the one who seduced him.
Eventually, it became vague who was the wrongdoer.
Given our weaker position, we couldn't fight back.
After all, that man's father is the Director of Personnel.
Unable to stand the discomfort, Shota wished for voluntary resignation.
It was accepted easily, without any attempt to hold him back.
But we don't regret it.
Neither Shota nor I.
The energy he's shown since deciding to quit...
It's more than ever before.
He's even put on two kilos in just a month.
When I realized that, I finally understood.
Regardless of the reasons, we'd managed to get on the right path.
Let's work hard from now on.
I'll be with you, always.
Yusaku: "..."
Chihiro: "Where did I put the scissors?"
Shota: "I used them just a while ago..."

Shota looks around curiously.
His gestures are unusually cute.
Chihiro: "Want to take a break?"
Shota: "After I finish packing the books into the box."

He hands me the scissors.
He's smiling brightly, like a child.
Chihiro: "Okay."
Shota: "You can take a break first, Chihiro."
Chihiro: "I want to be with you, Shota."
Shota: "..."

He gives a shy smile.
His white teeth are dazzling.
Ding-dong.
Chihiro: "...?"

I glance at the clock.
It's just past 1 in the afternoon.
The movers aren't supposed to come until the evening.
Who could it be?
Shota: "I'll get it."

He dusts himself off and goes to the entrance.
To keep the messy room from being seen, he properly closes the door to the living room.
Shota: "Ah!"
Yusaku: "You leave the door unlocked? That's careless."
I feel sick.
Yusaku: "Hmph..."


Aki, the fool, collapses with his eyes rolling back in his head.
I wrap his hands and feet with a rope meant for packing.
As a makeshift gag, I shove underwear into his mouth.
Of course, it's the one I stole from Chihiro.
You'll feel happy with this, won't you?
All this in just 30 seconds.
A quick piece of work.

Thud.
Shota: "Ugh…"
I finish with a kick to the stomach.
I don't care if he's already unconscious.
I'm walking on eggshells because of you guys.
Rumors are spreading, and they're not good.
Everyone's giving me the evil eye.
Damn it.
You're causing trouble for no reason.
It's up to you if you want to go back to your hometown.
Do as you please.
But I won't let it end like this.
You're not going anywhere until you've received my farewell gift.

The door between the entrance and the living room.
My grip on the knob naturally strengthens with my intense anger.
Click…creak…

Chihiro: "...Huh?"
Yusaku: "I'm sorry to bother you when you're so busy, ma'am."
Chihiro: "Za, Zama...Chief…"
Yusaku: "Unfortunately, I'm not a chief anymore. Thanks to someone snitching on me."
Chihiro: "Uh…"

The woman blinks her large eyes.
She stands frozen in surprise.
I casually move towards the window.
Of course, I never take my eyes off the woman.

Chihiro: "Sho, Shota is…"
Yusaku: "Well…"

I pretend to be clueless as I hook my finger on the window sash.
The window closes without a sound.
Naturally, the woman must have started to feel danger.
She's slowly backing away to put distance between us.

Yusaku: "Don't run away, ma'am."
Chihiro: "!!?"
I suddenly embrace her.
Her sweaty skin.
The feeling is disgustingly erotic.
Chihiro: "Wha, what are you doing!!"
Yusaku: "This."

I pull her struggling body towards me.
I attempt to push her down to the floor, leaning my weight onto her.
Chihiro: "Uh…"

But she resists, bracing her arms and legs.
She's a woman who doesn't give up easily.
My hand goes to the strap of her dress.
I'll take away her upper body's freedom first.

Chihiro: "Wai, wait…"
Too bad.
It's too late even if you're in a hurry.
Slide... Unzip... Thud.
Chihiro: "Nooooooo!!"

Everything is going according to plan.
The moment I pull her dress down to her upper arms, she loses her balance all at once.
As I lean my weight onto her, she falls backward onto the floor.
Even after falling, her breasts continue to sway for a while.


Bouncing, bouncing.
Bigger than I'd imagined, even through her clothes.
The perfect definition of a busty woman.
Yusaku: "Show me your pussy, too."
Squish.
Chihiro: "Hie..."
Her face contorts at the lewd words. 
I grab her crotch, underwear and all, and start to roughly knead.
The soft flesh squirms in my palm. 
Pubic hair peeks out from the side of the shifting panties.
Sometimes even the colored parts are exposed.
I can only swallow my saliva at this obscene sight.
An indescribable sensuality.
Chihiro: "Ah, agu... u..."
Her face is like a traffic light.
Red, then blue.
Too scared to even speak.
If you're so scared, why did you snitch to your husband?
You should have quietly obeyed.
Yusaku: "I said, show me your pussy."
Chihiro: "..."
Chihiro desperately shakes her head.
Yusaku: "Why are you refusing?"
Squish, knead.
Chihiro: "Ah... haa..."
Yusaku: "Is it so embarrassing, the color that bad?"
Chihiro: "Uu... ku..."
Yusaku: "Or does it stink so much it would make your nose curl?"
Squish, squish, squish.
Chihiro: "Agu... haa... haa... Shota... "
Yusaku: "Your husband's passed out."
Chihiro: "!?"
Yusaku: "You're worried, huh."
Chihiro: "Someone help..."
Mm, mmph...
Yusaku: "...If you're going to scream, you need to be prepared."
A threatening voice.
I pick up the scissors that had fallen to the floor.
Yusaku: "You understand, right?"
Chihiro: "If you're going to do something awful, I'd rather be dead."
Yusaku: "Hmm..."
The shiny silver blade.
I lick it with the tip of my tongue.
Yusaku: "It's not you I'm going to stab, it's your husband."
Chihiro: "...Eh?"
Her body shivers with a jerk.
Her face is pale.
She's more worried about that idiot than herself.
Yusaku: "Well, it's been a short life, but it can't be helped."
Chihiro: "If you do something like that, think about what will happen later..."
Yusaku: "Normally, you'd think so."
I bring my face closer and glare at her.
Yusaku: "But, you see."
Chihiro: "U..."
Yusaku: "I'm in a state of despair now."
Squish, squish, squelch...
Chihiro: "U, haa... stop, stop..."
Yusaku: "Let's have a competition."
Chihiro: "...Eh?"
Yusaku: "Whether your hand stops me first, or my hand stabs your husband first..."


Chihiro: "N-No... I can't..."
The woman vehemently shakes her head in rejection. It seems she has lost her will to scream out loud. Her body is also beginning to lose its strength. This is a serious problem. She's surrendering so easily, because she's so fond of that useless idiot, Akizuki.
Yusaku: "What in the world do you see in that guy?"
Chihiro: "Uu..."
Yusaku: "He doesn't seem like he has much male hormone."
Chihiro: "Hn..."
No matter what I ask, she just shakes her head. It's not entertaining when she's just scared.
Yusaku: "...Well, whatever."
Squeeze...
Chihiro: "Hi... Ah..."
Yusaku: "How many times a week do you have sex?"
Chihiro: "Uu... Ku..."
Yusaku: "Answer me."
Chihiro: "Hi... Uu..."
Yusaku: "You take his cock in here, don't you?"
Squeeze, squeeze...
Chihiro: "Uu... Ha... Ah..."
Yusaku: "Let's do the same thing with me."
Chihiro: "N-No, I don't want to."
The biggest rejection she's given so far. I take my hand away from her pussy, and move straight to her voluptuous breasts.
Squeeze, knead, squeeze, knead...
Chihiro: "P-Please don't touch me."
Yusaku: "They're big, huh."
Chihiro: "Hi... Gu... Ah..."
Yusaku: "What's your size?"
Chihiro: "Uu... Ah... Uu..."
Yusaku: "You don't want to tell a bastard like me, huh."
Squeeze hard.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Twisting and pulling the tip. Her nipples are small. The areolas are a bit large compared to them.
Yusaku: "...Turn around."
Chihiro: "Ah... Ah..."
Yusaku: "You should understand your position by now."
Tug.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I pulled the pubic hair peeking out from the side of her panties.
Yusaku: "As you can see, I'm frustrated."
Tug, snap.
Chihiro: "Ha... Uu... Uu..."
Yusaku: "Don't you think I'd be even more irritated if Akizuki woke up and started making a fuss?"
I take the scissors in my hand again. The atmosphere is getting more and more unpredictable.
Yusaku: "Let's get it over with before that happens, ma'am."
Chihiro: "Hi... Hii... Ah..."
A moan similar to a scream. Regardless, I force the woman to bend over. But she's not completely submissive. Still, her resistance is weak, far from strong. Her body is so drained that it almost makes me feel sympathy. Slide...
Chihiro: "Ah... Ah..."
The panties that were clinging to her ass. I pull them down to her thighs all at once.


Chihiro: "No...no way..."
The woman shakes her head again.
It seems she's lost the will to scream.
And along with that, the strength leaves her body.
This is bad.
She's raising the white flag too easily.
That useless idiot, Akizuki.
Yusaku: "What's so good about that guy?"
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Yusaku: "He doesn't seem to have much male hormones either."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
She just keeps refusing, no matter what I ask.
She's just scared. It's not fun.
Yusaku: "...Well, never mind."
Guni...
Chihiro: "Hii... ah..."
Yusaku: "How many times a week do you have sex?"
Chihiro: "Ugh... ah..."
Yusaku: "Answer me."
Chihiro: "Higguh...uh..."
Yusaku: "You've been taking his penis in here, haven't you?"
Guni, guni...
Chihiro: "Ugh...haah...ah..."
Yusaku: "Let's do the same thing with me."
Chihiro: "N-no..."
Her biggest refusal so far.
I pull my hand away from her pussy and head straight for her voluptuous breasts.
Guni, momi, guni, mimo.
Chihiro: "Please, don't touch me..."
Yusaku: "They're big, aren't they?"
Chihiro: "Hii...guh...ah..."
Yusaku: "What's the size?"
Chihiro: "Ugh...uh..."
Yusaku: "You don't want to tell a bastard like me, huh?"
Gyuu...
Chihiro: "Ah...!"
I twist and pull the tip.
The nipples are small.
In contrast, the areolas are a bit larger.
Yusaku: "...Turn around."
Chihiro: "Ah...ah..."
Yusaku: "Understand your position already."
Tsun...
Chihiro: "Ah...!"
The pubic hair peeking out from the side of her panties.
I pull it as if to pluck it out.
Yusaku: "As you know, I'm excited."
Tsun, puchi.
Chihiro: "Ha, hauh...uh..."
Yusaku: "Don't you think it'll be more annoying if Akizuki wakes up and starts making a fuss?"
I hold the scissors in my hand again.
The atmosphere is getting more and more unpredictable.
Yusaku: "Let's get it over with before that happens, ma'am."
Chihiro: "Higguh...hiiih...ah..."
A groan that sounded like a scream.
I make her lie face down, ignoring her.
Not that she's just letting me do what I want.
But her resistance is so weak it's far from that.
Her body is so drained of strength it makes me feel sorry for her.
Surun...
Chihiro: "Ah...uh..."
The panties clinging to her butt.
I pull them down to her thighs in one go.


The warmth seeping from inside.
The moist, clinging flesh.
What's this vagina?
Indiscriminately gentle, even in the midst of being raped.
Damn it.
This was what that fool got to taste every night.
Injustice is epitomized here.
Zug...guni...
Chihiro: "Higu..."
Finally, the tip reaches the deepest part.
The indecently spread entrance of the woman's vagina.
Most of my penis is buried in it.
This is wasted on him.
The pleasurable sensation that can only be understood when you go deep.
The superbness of this vagina seeps in from the surface.
Damn that Akitsuki fool.
He probably never reached this far, not even once, right?
But mine is different.
The glans is properly attached to the cervix.
Look.
Ma'am.
You understand this sensation, right?
Chihiro: "...eh?"
Byu, doku, doku, doku, doku, doku, doku.
Yusaku: "Kua...u..."
Chihiro: "Wa, wait..."
...doku...doku...dok...un...
Yusaku: "U...hi..."
The deepest part of the vagina.
I ejaculated towards the cervix.
And a lot of it.
The best sex of my life so far.
I didn't know the pleasure could be increased this much depending on how you do it.
Chihiro: "You didn't...inside..."
Yusaku: "Hehe, as if I would do something like that."
Guchu...u...
Chihiro: "No, you're lying...you're ejaculating...u..."
Yusaku: "I'm not ejaculating."
Guchu, guchu, toro...nupu...
Chihiro: "...no...I have to clean my vagina...please, to the bathroom..."
Yusaku: "..."
I was sure.
Only this woman can give me such pleasure.
That's why it's wasteful to end it in one go.
Again and again, and again.
I'll continue to ravish her until Akitsuki wakes up.
Ravish her until her labia swell.
Ejaculate until I run out of semen.
Guchurin.
Chihiro: "Hii...no...idiot...why inside...inhuman..."
Guchu...nupu...zunyu...nupu...nupu...u...
Chihiro: "Ah...it's no good...I have to clean my vagina...I have to clean it...dirty, dirty..."
...
...
...
...two days later...
Ding-dong.
Yusaku: "..."
Ding-dong.
Damn, it's noisy.
Don't keep ringing.
I don't pick up the intercom, I go directly to the front door.
I don't need to handle it, the person is obviously the same.
Kacha...


Plainclothes Police Officer: "Yusaku Zama?"
Yusaku: "..."
Three people to pick me up, huh?
Quite the effort for just me.
Yusaku: "You're late."
Plainclothes Police Officer: "Huh?"
Yusaku: "Why did you wait a day?"
The man in front of me is dumbstruck.
The two waiting behind him are tensing up, not sure what's happening.
Plainclothes Police Officer: "Does that mean you were prepared for this?"
Yusaku: "Well, yeah."
I give a relaxed smile.
Hurry up and arrest me.
I've always dreamed of riding in a patrol car since I was a kid.
Yusaku: "Come on."
I show them my watch, urging them on.
Yusaku: "Exactly 7:30 in the morning."
Plainclothes Police Officer: "..."
The officers exchange incredulous glances.
But they're not thrown off by something like this.
Professional as expected, having seen it all.
The sharp-eyed man in the lead flicks open a piece of paper right before my eyes.
Plainclothes Police Officer: "7:30 in the morning. Suspect secured. We're going to handcuff you now. Do you need a towel?"
Yusaku: "I don't need that kind of thing."
Plainclothes Police Officer: "So that's how it's going to be, huh? All right then."
Click, snap.
Yusaku: "Don't tighten them too hard."
Plainclothes Police Officer: "If you have a complaint, sue us in court."
Yusaku: "Hmph..."
I turn away, pretending not to hear.
I glance around the room I'm used to living in, for no particular reason.
Damn it.
It's a disastrous outcome.
Not a single happy person here.
I'm off to prison.
The Akitsuki couple goes without saying.
But hey.
Their misfortune doesn't end here.
The rape the other day was payback for snitching to the deputy.
So it's going to happen again.
This time for reporting to the police.
Mrs. Chihiro.
Look forward to it.
To the day I get out of prison.
I don't care what happens to you by then.
I will definitely find you and thank you.
Oops.
Just imagining it is getting me hard.
Maybe I'll go for anal instead of the vagina this time?
Yusaku: "Hehe..."
Plainclothes Police Officer: "What's so funny?"
Yusaku: "...Nothing."
Yank.
Yusaku: "...That hurts."
Plainclothes Police Officer: "Let's go."
Yusaku: "Alright, alright."
So, see you for now.
Until the day we meet again.
Lousy food.
Boring days.
Abuse from the prison guards.
I'll turn it all into anger and store it up.
I'll direct that anger at Chihiro after my release.
Remember it well.
Every hole in your body.


I'll make you shudder a hundred times for each one...
...
