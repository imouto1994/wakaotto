...Two days later...
Yusaku: "Hey, Akizuki!!"
...
Shota: "Y-Yes, Director Sazama."
Yusaku: "You're always late, aren't you?"
Shota: "I-I'm sorry."
Yusaku: "Well, I'll be out for about two hours from now. If someone from the General Affairs Department comes, give them these documents."
Shota: "Y-Yes."
Yusaku: "...Why are you so nervous?"
Shota: "No, nothing... really..."
I look down at his face.
Suddenly, a large amount of sweat breaks out on his forehead.
He's always been a timid man.
Yusaku: "...Well, never mind."
Shota: "..."
Yusaku: "I'll be back after four, so I'm counting on you till then... Assistant Director Akizuki."
Shota: "I-I understand."
...
...
...
Yusaku: "..."
Even though it's still July, it's damn hot.
Is Japan going to become subtropical?
Wiping my sweat, I stare at a certain building.
I'm waiting for a woman to come out.
I've been investigating a lot since then.
Of course, it's about Mrs. Chihiro Akizuki.
Most of the information comes from the stupid Akizuki himself.
He's digging his own grave, just like him.
Chihiro Akizuki, 25 years old, type A.
She graduated from a prestigious university with excellent grades.
After that, she worked for a major publishing company for three years.
And now she's a full-time housewife as her husband wants.
But she goes to a cooking class once a week.
Just one train station away from the town where she lives.
The building is just a minute away from the ticket gates, on the 3rd floor.
Yusaku: "..."
Oh.
Finally, she appears.
She's with a woman who seems to be a friend.
They seem to be having a fun conversation.
But that's within my expectations.
I pretend not to know her and turn my back.
I pretend to hail a taxi and wait for her to pass.
The distance between her and me is about 10 meters.
I keep a certain distance and follow her from behind.
She nods to her friend as soon as she passes through the ticket gate.
From there, they split to the left and right.
Mrs. Chihiro goes straight to the stairs.
I quickly close the gap there.
Yusaku: "..."
She's wearing a tight wine-red skirt.
It's like watching the continuation of an adult video.
Today's clothes make her figure more clear.
Oh man.
Her panty line is clearly visible.
She probably doesn't realize it.
Her round butt wrapped in thin fabric.
It was tight like a ripe blue fruit.
The curve from there to her thighs was drool-worthy.


The firmness of her slender, elongated legs is impeccable.
In other words, she has an outstanding figure.
Most of the men who pass by turn to look at her.
What the hell.
It seems I'm not the only one who thinks she's a good-looking woman.
...
Just as I finished climbing the stairs, the train slides in with perfect timing.
The time given to me is just for one station.
But there's no need to worry.
After all, it's the infamous strongest line.
The length of one section is guaranteed.
Clatter, rumble, clatter, rumble.
Yusaku: "..."
The reason why I targeted her on the return trip.
At this time, the trains heading down are more crowded.
And it's also a personal preference.
I prefer a slight steaminess to immediately after a shower.
She was right next to the door.
She stood there, absentmindedly looking outside.
Completely defenseless.
As soon as the train starts moving, I get behind her.
I get close enough that our bodies almost touch.
First, I savor the smell.
The faint scent of cosmetics.
That's fine.
Just as I imagined.
A strong perfume wouldn't suit you.
Next, I blatantly observe her from behind.
Because I'm at close range, my face moves exaggeratedly.
The woman's back is straight as a pin.
Her posture seems ridiculously good.
She looks like she lives her life in a very upright way.
The breasts visible over her shoulder are still huge.
The line of her bra was clearly visible on her back.
I extend my finger and pretend to unhook it.
The thrill of not knowing when she'll turn around is unbearable.
I wouldn't mind if she did.
We're already familiar with each other.
Including what I'm about to do.
It's like a greeting to get along.
Pito...
Chihiro: "!?"
W-What?
My body shudders in surprise.
I feel something touching my butt.
Is it just my imagination?
Chihiro: "..."
It's not my imagination.
Could it be a molester?
I knew someone was behind me for a while.
Even though it's not a crowded train, it's an uncomfortable feeling.
I thought so, but I ignored it while looking forward.
There are a lot of strange people around these days.
I don't want to create an odd trigger.
Pito...
Chihiro: "..."
Pito...peta...
Chihiro: "(W-Wait a minute...)"
It's definitely a molester.
It's not the feeling of a bag accidentally hitting me.
What should I do?
What should I do, what should I do?
Wriggle.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
No.
He's becoming more and more daring.
At first, it was just the feeling of his fingertips touching.
But now he's blatantly fondling my butt.
Someone, help me.


Even with those thoughts, I can't let out a voice.
But I can't just stay quiet.
Yet, I don't have the courage to turn around.
Wriggle, wriggle...
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
It's disgusting.
The man's finger creeping into the crevice of my buttocks.
The repulsiveness makes the goosebumps rise on my back.
I can't bear it any longer.
I take a small, deep breath.
Then I slowly bend my knees...
Guni.
Yusaku: "Guh..."
Chihiro: "..."
Direct hit.
The heel of my white pumps sinks into the man's shoe.
A small groan heard from behind.
Serves you right.
Yusaku: "..."
Wriggle.
Chihiro: "!?"
You're kidding me?
He's not giving up yet.
In fact, he's lifting up my skirt a little.
Stop.
I don't want that.
This time he's touching my buttocks directly over my stockings.
Chihiro: "...huh?"
But the man's actions far exceed my expectations.
This time, it wasn't my buttocks.
Incredibly, the molester's fingertips are in the space between my closed thighs.
As if to retaliate, they creep deeper and deeper.
Pito.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I feel the blood drain from my face.
It's not my first time experiencing a molester.
But it's the first time it's been this bold.
Probably his middle finger.
It's right up against my most precious part.
The only thing separating us is a thin piece of fabric.
It's as if there's no point in having stockings.
Chihiro: "..."
Frozen with my mouth hanging open.
I felt like even my heart had stopped.
Section Chief Hazama?
Eyes like a snake.
A suit I recognize.
Even the tie is the same as when he came to my house.
Yusaku: "Aren't you getting off?"
Chihiro: "Huh?"
The door is open.
We've arrived at the station before I knew it.
Chihiro: "..."
I bolt to the platform like a startled rabbit.
The moment his finger leaves my thigh.
It's just as disgusting as when it first slipped in.
Chihiro: "Haa...haa..."
From there, I run as fast as I can, almost losing my shoes.
Forgetting I'm wearing a skirt, I race up the stairs in one go.
I rush straight into the station's restroom.
Chihiro: "Nn...haa...haa...haa..."
Fortunately, there's no one around.
I go into a stall and slam the door shut.
Chihiro: "Ugh...ugh..."
I feel like I'm going to throw up.
I hold my stomach and take deep breaths over and over.
Desperately trying to avoid vomiting.
Chihiro: "Haa...haa..."
Somehow I endure.
But the unpleasant sensation lingering in my lower abdomen doesn't fade.
Chihiro: "My...underwear..."
Yes, my underwear.


The underwear that man touched.
I can't stand to wear it, it's disgusting.
I suddenly bite the bag in my mouth.
I pull down my shorts along with my stockings.
Somehow, while staggering, I take off my shoes.
One by one, I pull them off from my feet.
Chihiro: "..."
I don't even want to touch them anymore.
Of course, I have no intention of taking them home.
What caught my eye was the trash bin in the corner.
That's when I was going to throw my rolled-up underwear in there.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
The slimy sensation I felt on my fingertips.
I was shocked when I looked at that part.
Is it wet?
Because he touched me?
No way.
That's impossible.
Maybe it's because my period is near.
Even so, I'm greatly disturbed.
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Pure, clear stickiness.
I don't want to see it anymore.
Of course, I don't want to touch it either.
I almost turned away.
I blindly thrust my shorts into the trash bin.
I flushed the toilet and went outside so as not to seem strange.
I started walking as if nothing had happened.
At least, that's what I tried to pretend.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
But the strange sensation won't allow it.
My skirt feels unusually breezy.
Unconsciously, both my legs move inward to protect my defenseless lower half.
Especially when going down the stairs, I was really nervous.
I use the bag on my shoulder to guard the front.
While doing so, I stay alert to the back.
Almost acting suspiciously.
I even feel like all the men are looking at me.
In fact, I felt their gaze several times as they passed by.
Each time, I break out in a cold sweat.
But I can't quicken my pace.
Any action that raises my skirt even a little is totally rejected.
Please don't look.
Please ignore me.
The straight road home I'm used to.
In the heat and tension, it seemed to twist and turn.
But I have to keep my wits about me.
If I were to fall, it would be a disaster.
That would expose my precious parts.
I'm sure I wouldn't be able to live in this town anymore...
...
...
...
Chihiro: "..."
I arrived at my room, panting heavily.
Of course, I don't have time to sit down.
Before anything else, I head to the dressing room.
I strip off my sweaty clothes from my body.
Without even folding them, I open the bathroom door.
I just want to wash my body.
I want to clean the part that was touched.
That's all I could think about.
Shaaaaa...
Chihiro: "Puh..."


A cold shower from the top of my head.
Desperately cooling my skin that's burning with shame.
My heart is still pounding.
Just remembering it makes my face turn red.
This is the first time I've felt so embarrassed.
All because of that man.
But right now, I won't think about anything.
If I thought about it, I'd probably panic again.
Such an unbelievable event.
Could it have been a dream?
Chihiro: "..."
I timidly touch my lower abdomen.
I have to touch it to clean it.
Squish...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I'm surprised again.
It's still wet.
Why?
Quite a bit of time has passed since I was molested.
Why is it so wet, like right after being caressed?
Sho-chan.
My body has become strange.
Ring... ring...
Chihiro: "...?"
A call?
Could it be Sho-chan?
Did my plea for help get through?
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
His face comes to my mind.
I feel like crying.
I want to talk to Sho-chan.
I'm desperate for any straw to clutch.
I wrap a bath towel that I took from the shelf around my body.
Hoping that the ringing won't stop, I rush to the receiver.
Click.
Chihiro: "Hello?"
Yusaku: "...Thank you for earlier."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "You went straight home, didn't you?"
Chihiro: "Do, do you need something?"
Yusaku: "I was worried if you arrived safely."
Chihiro: "..."
That's as far as I could manage to stand.
Strength drains from my body as if my bones had disappeared.
I fell to the floor.
It wasn't a dream.
It was reality.
I was molested by Section Chief Zama.
But why?
Why me?
Chihiro: "Wa, was it a coincidence?"
Yusaku: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "..."
I think it's a stupid question, even to myself.
But if it was a coincidence, I could have found the answer.
Section Chief Zama is a habitual molester.
I just happened to be there.
Yusaku: "How about dinner sometime?"
Chihiro: "Eh?"
Yusaku: "As a thank you for treating me the other day."
Chihiro: "Pl, please answer me properly."
Section Chief Zama's voice is like a suppressed laugh.
Chihiro: "I want to know if it was a coincidence."
Yusaku: "I wonder what you like, ma'am."
Chihiro: "..."


Yusaku: "If you like, how about my apartment? I'll make sure to prepare thick radishes and bumpy cucumbers for you."
Chihiro: "Wha, what nonsense are you..."
Click.
Chihiro: "Haa... Haa..."
I hung up the phone abruptly.
What on earth was that?
I'm so creeped out that I can't stop shaking.
It's like I'm living a real nightmare now.
Anyway, I need to calm down.
I need to think clearly.
The molestation was a coincidence.
The invitation to dinner was just a return favor.
If I think like that, I can still see a glimmer of hope.
Maybe something like this will never happen again.
...
Is that really true?
If it was a coincidence, even Chief Zama should have been flustered.
But when I looked back on the train, he was unnervingly calm.
His voice on the phone was infuriatingly composed.
I can't help but think he knew what he was doing.
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
It's hopeless.
I'll consult with Sho-chan when he gets back.
Since the other party is Chief Zama, it's not just my problem anymore.
That's the only way.
I can't think of any other solution...
...
...
...
Yusaku: "Hey, Akizuki!!"
Shota: "Y-Yes, Section Chief Zama."
Yusaku: "You're early this time, aren't you?"
Shota: "I-I was on standby, waiting to be called."
Yusaku: "...I see."
While nodding, his gaze shifts to the desk.
He's going through the documents with a serious face.
These are the things that Akizuki dealt with while I was away.
As usual, there are many minor mistakes.
But there's no fatal failure.
Well, he probably thinks he did well.
Yusaku: "Akizuki-kun."
Shota: "Y-Yes."
Go ahead
Praise him as if a fool has climbed a tree
Yusaku: "You can go now."
Shota: "Eh?"
Yusaku: "I said you can go."
Shota: "U-Understood."
Yusaku: "..."
Was he expecting words of appreciation or something?
Stupid fool.
He's naive.
No matter how hard he tries, he's not valued.
It's fine for him to keep stressing himself out like that.
Yusaku: "You did a good job, didn't you?"
Shota: "R-Really?"
Yusaku: "..."
Such a contrived guy.
He was expecting some words of appreciation after all.
Yusaku: "You did a great job."
Shota: "Th-Thank you."


Yusaku: "It might be time to move on to the next step."
Shota: "Eh?"
Yusaku: "You should attend the meeting with the deputy chief."
Shota: "..."
Seems like this was unexpected for him.
His small eyes are widening even more.
Yusaku: "I think it wouldn't hurt for your future."
Shota: "Me, in a meeting with the deputy chief?"
Yusaku: "If you don't want to, you don't have to."
Shota: "N-No, it's not that I don't want to..."
Yusaku: "Just listening to the discussions will be a learning experience. It'll be busier than before, but it's a path everyone takes when getting promoted."
Shota: "Pr-promotion..."
Yusaku: "If you understand, then get back to your desk. There's still work left, isn't there?"
Shota: "I-I'll continue to do my best. Section Chief, thank you in advance."
Yusaku: "..."
Yusaku: "Hmph."
As expected, he climbed up the tree.
Well, I have to keep a bit of insurance.
It's been a while since I found a woman I like.
I won't let her get away so easily.
The attitude of the woman I molested.
She endures without making a scene.
But if it goes beyond a certain line, she won't just remain a docile woman.
That's why I pleased him.
For a while, I'll let him climb the tree.
But after that, there won't be any more candy.
Just you watch.
I'll push him into increasingly unrewarding situations.
He'll be swamped with impossible tasks.
Of course, no one will help him.
So, the stress will keep piling up.
That will inevitably affect his personal life.
Both his mind and body will be worn out.
His beloved wife will surely be worried.
Yes, indeed.
As long as she just worries.
Yusaku: "Hmph..."
I'll just keep tormenting him slowly.
I won't change anything for him.
So, the one who will break is him.
And what happens when he breaks?
Well, he'll come begging to me, bowing his head.
Saying that he wants to eat with me.
...
