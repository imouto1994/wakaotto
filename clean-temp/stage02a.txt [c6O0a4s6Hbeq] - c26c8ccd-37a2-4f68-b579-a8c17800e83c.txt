...The same day, 11:00 PM...
Ding-dong.
Chihiro: "Coming."
Chihiro: "Welcome home."
Shota: "I'm home."
Chihiro: "...?"
He seems unusually cheerful compared to usual.
It's strange, considering he came home late.
Chihiro: "You must be tired."
Shota: "Yeah."
Nodding, he heads towards the living room.
He starts taking off his tie, humming a tune.
Something is off.
Chihiro: "Do you want to take a bath first?"
Shota: "I wonder which to do first..."
Shota, who can't undo the knot tied too tightly, is struggling with his tie in frustration.
Naturally, I go to his side.
I gently reach out to the part of the tie shaped like a rice ball.
Chihiro: "Um, you see..."
Shota: "What?"
Shota grins at close range.
Seeing his expression makes my heart waver a bit.
If I consult with him, this smile will disappear.
But I can't keep it a secret.
I have to tell him properly.
Because it's important.
Chihiro: "Actually, there's something I want to talk about..."
Shota: "Me too."
Chihiro: "Huh?"
I instinctively step back.
It's due to the voice he let out.
It was surprisingly full of vigor.
Chihiro: "Wha, what's going on?"
His nostrils flaring.
He always does this when he's excited.
It seems like he's itching to talk about something.
Chihiro: "...It's fine if you go first, Shota."
Shota: "I've been praised."
Chihiro: "...By who?"
Shota: "By Section Chief Hazama."
Chihiro: "..."
I just open my mouth in surprise.
I'm looking at his flared nostrils.
Shota: "He said you should also attend the meeting with the Deputy Chief."
Chihiro: "Did, did the Section Chief say that too?"
Shota: "Yeah, he said it's a path everyone takes when they get promoted."
Chihiro: "...When getting promoted..."
Shota: "I thought he was just a tough guy, but he's actually been evaluating me. Today, I feel like I finally understood the Section Chief's intentions."
Shota: "It seems like I'm quite expected. That's why I was treated much more harshly than the other irrelevant guys."
Chihiro: "...I, I see."
Shota: "I used to be a nobody among my peers, but I think people's perception of me will change from now on. I'm starting to feel motivated."
Chihiro: "..."
Shota really seems happy.
This is the first time I've seen him like this.
Everything he has been enduring has been rewarded.


I can feel his excitement intensely.
Shota: "So, what about you, Chihiro?"
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Shota: "You said you had something to talk about too, right?"
Chihiro: "Ah, no, I..."
I can't anymore.
At least not now.
I can't dampen his cheerful mood.
Chihiro: "I... I've managed to make the dish I learned."
Shota: "Well done."
Chihiro: "Y-Yes."
Shota: "I'm looking forward to you making it for me."
The tie I had loosened.
Now he easily starts to take it off.
Again, he hums a tune.
He seems like he might start dancing if left alone.
Chihiro: "..."
What just happened?
Praised by the section chief?
As far as I know, it's the first time.
That's why he's so happy.
Maybe an apology for the molestation?
No way.
Such a thought is disrespectful to Shota.
He was praised because he worked hard.
His struggles were rewarded.
Of course that's the case.
But I still feel uneasy.
It seems like not just the things I failed to say are the cause.
Something else, somewhere different.
Perhaps something I can't even imagine right now.
That's what's making me feel unresolved...
...
...
...
Yusaku: "Kuh..."
Yusaku: "Ha...ha...ha..."
Nice.
It feels much better than usual.
There's no need to watch AV today.
The sensation of her pussy left on my middle finger.
And the image of Chihiro that pops into my mind.
With just that, I feel like I could cum three times.
Wife.
She was sexy.
Someday, suck this penis.
This dick that's become hard as a demon.
Babiu!!
Yusaku: "Hauu!!"
As usual, the gushing momentum is tremendous.
But today, I don't shoot towards the ceiling.
Just before the semen spurts from the tip.
I wrapped my penis with Chihiro's underwear that I stole.
The target is the part that touched her pussy.
I ejaculate fully onto it.
Just this doubles the pleasure.
It makes me feel like I've indirectly violated that woman.
I'm in trouble.
It seems I'm quite invested.
Is it love at first sight?
No way.
It's not such a sweet emotion.
I'm just very interested.
How a neat young wife, devoted to her husband, would go mad.
I can't help but want to confirm that...
...
...
...
Shota: "...I'm home."
Chihiro: "You must be tired."
Shota: "...Yeah."
Chihiro: "..."


I waited for his return with Chiaki's thoughts in mind.
But Shota's face was more tired than yesterday.
As if to add insult to injury, my heart wavered slightly.
Chihiro: "..."
No.
I have to discuss it properly.
Because it's important.
Chihiro: "Shall I take a bath first?"
Shota: "What should I do?"
His words didn't continue.
He started to take off his tie with a tired look.
The bag he entrusted to me was put on the table's chair.
The handle is quite worn out.
Shota always endures.
He rarely buys things for himself.
Even when we go to the store together, he hesitates there.
"Why don't we get something we can use together?"
He says that with a gentle smile.
That's why, for his next birthday.
I decided to give him a bag as a gift.
Thank you for always working hard.
I'm sorry for making you tired.
I'm really sorry.
Chihiro: "Um... Shota..."
Shota: "Hm?"
Chihiro: "There's something I want to talk about."
Shota: "What is it, all of a sudden?"
Chihiro: "..."
Did he notice the unusual atmosphere?
His hand, which was taking off his tie, stops.
Shota: "...What's wrong?"
Chihiro: "..."
What should I say first?
I gaze into Shota's eyes.
This is not a trivial matter for him either.
So I have to explain clearly and in order.
So that it can be settled in one go.
Chihiro: "Actually..."
Shota: "Y-Yes."
About seeing his penis in the dressing room.
Looking back, that might have been intentional.
And about being molested on the way home from the cooking class.
About getting a phone call and being invited to dinner.
I deliberately suppressed my emotions and started to talk about each one.
Shota was nodding at first.
But halfway through, he even forgot to respond.
He just looked as if his blood had been drained.
Shota: "...Za... Section Chief Zama?"
Chihiro: "..."
I nod slightly.
That's all I can manage to do.
Is it because I felt relieved after discussing it?
Tears start to flow freely like a plug has been pulled.
I couldn't stand it and threw myself into his chest.
Shota, who was confused but still hugged me.
That alone is enough.
All the fear and anxiety disappear.
I'm glad I consulted him.
I'm glad the person who is holding me is him.
That's why I regret a little.
The attitude I took when I was molested.
The vague resistance is terribly cursed.
I swear strongly in my heart.
This body belongs only to Shota.


I won't let anyone but him touch me ever again...
