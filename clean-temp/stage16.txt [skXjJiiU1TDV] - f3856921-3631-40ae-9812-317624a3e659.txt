...Two days later...
Shota: "Well, I'm off."
Chihiro: "Will you be late today?"
Shota: "Probably normal."
Chihiro: "Then, I'll make a delicious meal and wait for you."
Shota: "U, um... "
Chihiro: "...?"
Shota: "Um... "
Chihiro: "...What's wrong?"
Shota: "I wonder if it's the effect of pregnancy."
Chihiro: "Eh?"
Shota: "I feel like your breasts have gotten a little bigger..."
Chihiro: "Ah... eh, yeah... probably..."
Shota: "I thought so."
Chihiro: "...Is it noticeable?"
Shota: "Not at all."
Chihiro: "...I see."
Shota: "Chihiro's breasts have always been beautifully shaped."
Chihiro: "...Thanks."
Shota: "Well, I'm really off now. I'm looking forward to dinner."
Chihiro: "Take care."
Chihiro: "..."
Chihiro: "...It's the second day today."
Yes.
It's already been two days.
The passage of time feels unbelievably fast.
Even though the incident happened the day before yesterday, it feels very far away.
I'm not sure if I've been able to forget about my uncle since then.
But I felt like something had changed.
The presence of the section chief was between me and my disgusting memory.
It feels like half of my past has been blocked.
If I look back, I feel like I'll be scolded by him.
So, I consciously look straight ahead.
I avoid the corners when walking through the town.
I even dared to wear underwear that fits me.
My breasts are a size larger than before.
But it's no big deal when I try.
To be honest, I was a little embarrassed.
At least I'm not as scared as I was before.
Chihiro: "..."
I know.
I am a bad wife.
Surprisingly so.
I had an affair while carrying the child of the man I love.
I'm a woman who has climaxed many times with a penis other than my husband's.
But... 
That cold voice.
The constant mean words.
I was bullied over the phone again yesterday.
I was even made to do the dishes naked.
And yet, for some reason, I...
Despite the fact that I'm supposed to love Shota the most...
I'm waiting for the home phone to ring again...
...
......
.........
...That night...
Squelch...
Chihiro: "Mm..."
Chihiro: "Mm... Mm... Mm... Mm... Mm..."
Shota: "Ah..."
Chihiro: "Mm... Squelch... Mm... Mm... Mm... Mm... Mm..."
Shota: "Ah... Ah... Ch, Chihiro..."


Chihiro: "...Shota... I love you..."
Shota: "I, I'm... I'm... I'm... coming..."
Squirt.
Shota: "Haaah... for the first time... I came... in Chihiro's mouth..."
Chihiro: "Mm... Mm... Mm... gulp... Mm... gulp... Mm..."
Shota: "It, it feels amazing."
Chihiro: "...Then, let's continue..."
Shota: "Eh... eh...?"
Chihiro: "Cum again."
Shota: "I, I've never done that before."
Chihiro: "From today, we'll do it twice every day."
Shota: "Eh~"
Squelch.
Shota: "U... hi..."
Chihiro: "Mm... Mm... Mm... Mm... slurp... Mm... Mm..."
Shota: "Haah... haah... Ch, Chihiro... I can't... anymore..."
Chihiro: "I want you to feel good, a lot."
Shota: "Ha... u... uh..."
Chihiro: "Mm... Mm... Mm... Mm... Mm... haah... Mm... Mm..."
More.
More, more.
I want to swallow Shota's semen.
The resistance to doing so is completely gone.
My desire to serve him overcomes everything else.
I've definitely changed.
I don't even wear a bra when I go to bed anymore.
So that when he reaches out to me...
He can touch the soft part immediately...
Chihiro: "...Shota."
Shota: "Wh, what?"
Chihiro: "...I'm sorry for everything until now."
Shota: "Wh, why are you apologizing?"
Chihiro: "Mm... slurp... for various things... Mm... Mm... gulp... Mm..."
Shota: "Ah... Chihiro..."
Chihiro: "...Say I'm clumsy."
Shota: "Yo, you're good."
Chihiro: "I want you to say that."
Shota: "Cl, clumsy."
Chihiro: "...One more time."
Shota: "Clumsy."
Chihiro: "...Thanks."
Shota: "Wh, weird Chihiro."
Chihiro: "Yes..."
I'm really strange, aren't I?
I still find comfort in being belittled.
But I was honest enough to beg for it.
The act itself is very natural.
So Shota isn't confused either.
He gets his penis hard properly and leaves himself to what I do.
Chihiro: "Slurp... Mm... Mm... Mm... lick... kiss..."
Shota: "Haah... Chihiro..."
Chihiro: "Let's do it tomorrow."
Shota: "Wh, what?"
Chihiro: "...Sex."
Shota: "Bu, but..."


Chihiro: "My body is fine. As long as Shota is gentle with me, the baby won't be startled." 
*smooching sound* 
Shota: "Ah..."
Chihiro: "Promise me."
Shota: "Y-yeah..."
Chihiro: "I'm glad... Mm... Mm... Hmm..."
Shota: "Ah... Aaah... I'm about to... again..."
Chihiro: "...Let it out."
Shota: "I'm... I'm... I'm... coming..."
*sound of ejaculation* 
Chihiro: "Mmm..."
Shota: "Aaah... That feels... good..."
Chihiro: "Mmm... Mmm... gulp... more... let it out..."
Shota: "Aaah... Chihiro... Chihiro..."
Chihiro: "Mmm... slurp... lick... more... more..."

...One week later...
*doorbell rings* 
Chihiro: "Yes?"
Shota: "...I'm home."
Chihiro: "We-welcome home."
Shota: "Sigh..."
Chihiro: "T-today's dinner is Shota's favorite..."
Ah...
Chilled Somen noodles and tempura, you see.
I swallowed the words that were about to say.
Chihiro: "I-it was really hot today, wasn't it?"
Shota: "Yeah..."
Chihiro: "..."

Shota, who's been feeling down for several days.
At first, I thought it was just summer fatigue.
But it seems to be something different.
Probably something happened at work.
There's a reason I think it's not just a wild guess.
Besides his lack of energy, there's more.
The calls from the Section Chief, coming in almost daily.
They abruptly stopped five days ago.
The time when Shota started acting strange and this, are almost the same.
Just a coincidence?
I want to think so, but I can't put two and two together.
In the end, I can't help but worry.
I should ask, I should ask.
That's what I've been thinking for the past two days.
Even if I call, the Section Chief doesn't pick up.
And he doesn't leave a message.
I'm at my limit of patience.
I have no choice but to ask Shota to find out what's going on.

Chihiro: "Hey, um..."
Shota: "...Hm?"
Chihiro: "Did something happen?"
Shota: "What do you mean 'something'?"
Chihiro: "I-I don't know, that's why I'm asking."
Shota: "...Why would you ask something like that?"
Chihiro: "Because you're not yourself."
Shota: "Who isn't?"
Chihiro: "Shota."
Shota: "...I see."
Chihiro: "..."

A moment of silence.
A feeling of something serious more than I thought.
Thanks to that, I'm losing my composure more and more.
My words are becoming more and more direct.
Chihiro: "H-How's the Section Chief?"


Shota: "Huh?"
Chihiro: "Recently, you haven't mentioned anything about the department manager."
Shota: "...Yeah."
Chihiro: "You used to tell me about your conversations with him, where you went together... Why did you stop?"
Shota: "...He's on leave."
Chihiro: "What?"
Shota: "The manager is currently on leave at home."
Chihiro: "..."
Chihiro: "On... leave?"
I'm completely blank. My eyes widen.
Chihiro: "What do you mean?"
Shota: "Sigh..."
Shota starts to untie his tie in front of the closet. From then on, it's a parade of sighs.
Shota: "At best he'll be demoted, at worst he'll be dismissed. That's what they said."
Chihiro: "So, what does that mean?"
Shota: "I only heard it from the assistant manager, I don't know the details. Well, I have some idea about what started it all..."
Chihiro: "What started it?"
Shota: "You know, the official from the Ministry of Debt we entertained at the pool?"
Chihiro: "Uh, yeah."
Shota: "I think he's probably the source of the trouble. The manager was doing various things, it seems."
Chihiro: "..."
The official from the Ministry of Debt. That man who said he would push through negotiations by threatening. But he should have erased the blackmail material. Did he act recklessly because of that? 
My blank mind starts to whirl. Anyway, the fact that it's not unrelated makes the blood drain from my face.
Chihiro: "Did he do something so bad to be put on leave?"
Shota: "Like I said, I don't know the details."
Chihiro: "I... I'm sorry."
Shota: "With the manager gone, the budget department is in shambles. No one wants to take responsibility, and they keep asking me all sorts of questions... sigh..."
Shota: "I realize now just how big he was. How much work he managed, how much responsibility he carried... phew..."
Chihiro: "Why don't you discuss it over the phone?"
Shota: "That's prohibited until a judgement has been made."
Chihiro: "Wh...what?"
Shota: "For civil servants, rules are everything."
Chihiro: "..."
Shota's face looks frustrated as he says that. He really wants to call. Not just to consult about work, but to cheer up the respected manager. That feeling shows strongly on his face.
Chihiro: "You'll be okay."
Shota: "I hope at least he'll only be demoted..."


Chihiro: "Even if he's demoted, it would be troublesome for you, wouldn't it, Shota?"
Shota: "...Yeah."
Chihiro: "It'll work out somehow."
Shota: "...I wonder."
Chihiro: "After all, the manager's father is in Human Resources..."
Shota: "I think we can't rely on that anymore."
Chihiro: "Why not?"
Shota: "Because they're actually at odds with each other."
Chihiro: "Whaat?"
Shota: "The department manager and his father, who is the director of Human Resources."
Chihiro: "..."
I make a dumbfounded face. I don't need to look in a mirror to know what expression I'm making.
Shota: "You can't believe rumors about people. They used to say he got into the office and became a manager because of his father's connections, but..."
Shota: "As it turns out, all that was a big lie. At least since before he joined the office, it seems his relationship with his father was strained."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
During the festival. The manager was overly competitive with the Human Resources Department. Even when the topic of resignation came up as a result of a bet. The moment it became a conversation about his father, his eyes took on a look I'd never seen before. Probably what Shota says is true. It aligns with the manager's attitude.
That's right. If he wanted to trouble me, he wouldn't need lewd photos. If he used his father's position, he could threaten as much as he wanted. "If you defy me, your husband will be fired." If it was the beginning, I might have had to obey with just that. But he didn't do that. Even Shota doesn't know they have a bad relationship. Why didn't he use it, not even as a bluff? Is their relationship so acrimonious that it's disgusting to mention? If that's the case, will he really be demoted? At worst, will he be dismissed?
Chihiro: "..."
I start to tremble. Pretending to remember something, I head to the Japanese-style room. By any standard, my behavior has become abnormal. I don't want Shota to notice. How did it come to this? Is it my fault? At least it's certain that it's not unrelated. I was the one who said I didn't want him to use that video.
Chihiro: "..."
Before I know it, I take out my cell phone. Even before turning on the room light, I was calling the manager. Once, twice. As usual, he doesn't answer. No matter how many times I call, it's the same. If he's on leave, he should be at home. What on earth could be happening? Is he so depressed that he doesn't even have the energy to answer? No...


That's not like him. He's such a strong person. He's probably in the bathroom. Or maybe taking a bath.
Chihiro: "..."
After 10 consecutive calls. All results are the same. I can't do this anymore. Tears are streaming down from my eyes for no reason. Somehow, in the dimly lit room, I end up imagining him sitting all alone.
Beep.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
The photo taken when I was treated. For some reason, I haven't deleted it. The manager is looking at me with the camera. His big, hard penis. The rough hand that's holding it. Everything is blurred by tears. I can't go on like this. Shota is also in trouble. What should I do? What should I do, what should I do...
...
...
...
...The next day, at noon...
Yusaku: "..."
Yusaku: "...heh."
Recently, all these molestation things are all about buses. It's obviously a chartered bus, the lack of realism is amazing. Thanks to that, I don't feel like masturbating. But I have high expectations for the next title. After all, it's about a young wife being molested by a doctor. Please, man. Despite being free, I've abstained from masturbation for two days.
...
Yusaku: "Tch..."
Damn it. This is no good. I knew it as soon as I started watching. The camera moves too much during the examination. It goes to the chest, then to the face. Reacts to every line and moves around restlessly. At times like these, you should pull back and fix the shot. This damn guy. Die once. Die for my sake.
Ding-dong.
Yusaku: "..."
Who is it? Who's disturbing my precious masturbation time? An idiot with bad timing. You can die too.
Yusaku: "Oops..."
Retraction. You don't have to die. The dignified figure reflected in the intercom. She's not as jittery as usual. Is she forcing her expression? She's glaring at the lens with a scary face. What the heck, man. Did you come to complain that the treatment isn't working?
Click...
Chihiro: "...Hello."
Yusaku: "What are you here for?"
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "I don't remember calling you."
Chihiro: "Do I need to be called to come?"
Yusaku: "This is my room."
Chihiro: "The manager also came to our house many times."
Yusaku: "So what do you want?"
Chihiro: "It's strange to leave things as they are."
Yusaku: "Huh?"


Chihiro: "It's strange for you to be sitting in your room doing nothing."
Yusaku: "...I don't understand what you're saying."
Chihiro: "Please, don't play dumb."
Yusaku: "I seriously don't understand."
Chihiro: "Are you really on suspension?"
Yusaku: "..."
What's this about? That talkative chief. He said too much.
Yusaku: "Go home."
Chihiro: "No."
Yusaku: "If you don't go home, I'll rape you."
Chihiro: "Do as you like."
Yusaku: "Hey, hey."
Chihiro: "Rape me quickly."
Yusaku: "...What did you hear from your husband?"
Chihiro: "Various things."
Yusaku: "Don't let outsiders meddle."
Chihiro: "I'm not unrelated either. My husband said the issue at the pool, the one you were trying to blackmail, was related to the Ministry of Debt."
Yusaku: "And what can you do about it?"
Chihiro: "If you need photos, please take them again. I'll go to the place you instructed me to, right now."
Yusaku: "Hmm..."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "...This is surprising."
Chihiro: "I'm not saying this as a joke."
Yusaku: "You were so against it before, what changed your mind?"
Chihiro: "Because..."
Yusaku: "Say it."
Chihiro: "Without the manager, Shota will be in trouble. In fact, he said the budget department has fallen apart..."
Yusaku: "Is that all?"
Chihiro: "Yes, that's it."
Yusaku: "Well, whatever the reason for your change of heart, I don't plan on relying on you either way."
Chihiro: "Why not?"
Yusaku: "Just because."
Chihiro: "Then rely on your father."
Yusaku: "..."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "If you say that word again, I'll kill you."
Chihiro: "Even if you don't get along, he's still your family..."
Yusaku: "We get along just fine."
Chihiro: "That's a lie."
Yusaku: "Either way, I'm not at an age where I need to rely on my parents."
Chihiro: "This is not the time to say such things."
Yusaku: "...You're getting too involved in other people's complicated affairs."
Chihiro: "You're not a stranger to me."
Yusaku: "Indeed, we're in a perpetrator-victim relationship."
Chihiro: "Please, don't phrase it like that."
Yusaku: "Just go home already."


Chihiro: "I won't move a step out of this room until you call your father."
Yusaku: "...You're persistent."
Chihiro: "I'm fine with that for now."
Yusaku: "He won't help because we get along too well."
Chihiro: "I don't know that. We have to do something before the decision from the Personnel Bureau comes out..."
Yusaku: "The decision has already been made."
Chihiro: "...What?"
Yusaku: "I just got a phone call. It's decided. I'm being transferred to the provinces."
Chihiro: "No way..."
Yusaku: "Now that you understand, go home."
Chihiro: "If you're transferred, my husband will be in trouble."
Yusaku: "I heard that earlier."
Chihiro: "That's not like you."
Yusaku: "What isn't?"
Chihiro: "Giving up... that's not like you!"
Yusaku: "Who said anything about giving up?"
Chihiro: "...What?"
Yusaku: "I don't plan to end it here."
Chihiro: "What are you going to do?"
Yusaku: "Once the verdict is out, my suspension will be lifted. This is when the real counterattack begins."
Chihiro: "Counterattack...?"
Yusaku: "I'm going to settle the score with the lecherous officials."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "So, there's no role for you."
Chihiro: "Please, let me help in some way."
Yusaku: "...Enough already."
Thump.
Chihiro: "Kyaa!!"
Squeeze.
Chihiro: "It... hurts..."
Yusaku: "Oh, the bra size fits, doesn't it?"
Squeeze, squeeze.
Chihiro: "Wait a minute..."
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
Chihiro: "Ow, it hurts."
Yusaku: "...Go home."
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
Chihiro: "But, we still have to talk..."
Yusaku: "I've got nothing more to say."
Chihiro: "Don't push me so roughly..."
Ah...
Yusaku: "Goodbye."
Slam!!
Yusaku: "..."
Yusaku: "...Hmph."
Damn it.
She's a busybody.
Getting all worked up like a fool.
Rely on the Personnel Bureau's crap chief?
Don't talk nonsense.
My father, the idiot who pretended to be all about work.
"I'm the one who feeds you all."
Proudly declaring this while having an affair.
Divorced when I was 12.
Then, acting as if nothing happened, he remarried her immediately.
Both the marriage partner and the stepchild are the worst kind of people.
Of course, I left home.
In the heat of an argument, I took only my belongings.
But the world isn't so sweet.


The mother I relied on was a live-in part-timer, so it wasn't easy to just move in with her. Thanks to that, I've been independent since I was a kid. I started by lying about my age and spending my days working part-time jobs.

Yusaku: "Tch..."

Since then, I've been constantly fighting with my father. We always end up in a fistfight whenever we meet, so we mostly just communicate through the phone. At first, our conversations would start out calm, but they always ended up in a shouting match just before hanging up. Once we got on each other's nerves, that was it. All that was left was to shout and rant as the mood took us.

One day, about five minutes after I had a huge fight with my bastard father, the phone rang again. It was past 1 am. Of course, I had no intention of answering it. I would ignore it no matter how long it rang. But it was so persistent that I lifted the receiver slightly and carelessly hung up.

It was the next day when I found out that the call was from my mother. A heart attack, was it? The type where you die suddenly if you don't get help in time. In other words, it was a call for help to me.

I was pretty down about it. But no matter how much I regretted it, I couldn't turn back time. All I could do was accept her miserable death. At the funeral home, the funeral was modest. There were only a few mourners out of sympathy. Reluctantly, the shitty old man came too.

He looked at the portrait of the deceased, of course, without shedding a tear. Instead of a condolence money, he had two terrible things to say. "I'm glad I divorced her." "I'll get you a job in the city hall with my connections."

Bullshit. Who's going to depend on you? I can get into a petty city hall on my own. Just you watch. I'll surpass you. Then I'll go visit your happy home and make your remarried wife suck my penis. I don't care if it's seen as holding a grudge. I'll climb to the top, even if I have to use any means necessary, and become the director. I'll use that bastard like a puppet.

To do that, I need to get hold of the dirty officials' weaknesses and build a strong network. Even at the level of initial trials, failure is not an option. If it's a worthless dirty official, a few days of stalking will surely reveal something. If not, then...
