Yusaku: "Madam, you should also have a drink or two."
Chihiro: "Ah... no, I..."
Yusaku: "Celebrating alone feels a bit lonely, doesn't it, Akizuki Section Chief?"
Shota: "Y-yes."
Yusaku: "Did it resemble him?"
Shota: "Eh?"
Yusaku: "I was imitating the Deputy Manager."
Shota: "I-I see."
Yusaku: "It's not a place for you to just nod and agree. Then there's no point in my making a joke."
Shota: "S-sorry."
Yusaku: "Well, never mind, drink up, drink up."
Shota: "Y-yes."
Chihiro: "..."

An unreasonably bright smile. This is the first time I've seen such a devil. But that's only on the surface. 

Chihiro: "Ah..."
Beneath the table, it's a different world. As always, I'm forced to spread my legs and endure this devil's humiliation. I'm not even allowed to put on my underwear.

Chihiro: "Um... what about the meal...?"
Yusaku: "Let's just stick with snacks for now. It's still early and you're not that hungry... right, Akizuki Section Chief?"
Shota: "Ha ha ha...yes..."
Chihiro: "Ah..."

Is he imitating the Deputy Manager again? Shota, you fool. Instead of forcing a smile, you should say you're hungry. Then I'd have an excuse to go to the kitchen.

Chihiro: "Then, I'll get a new beer..."
Yusaku: "No need, madam, just sit."
Chihiro: "Ah... yes."

The devil didn't even wait for my reply and stood up. He opened the refrigerator on his own and took out a beer. He's been doing this all along. He won't even let me go get my oolong tea.

Chihiro: "...Shota."
Shota: "Hmm?"
Chihiro: "Tell the manager later that you're hungry..."
Yusaku: "What are you talking about?"
Chihiro: "Uh..."

The beer is being poured into Shota's glass. I wonder how many glasses he's had. He's not a heavy drinker. But he's still drinking as he's being urged to.

Chihiro: "...Are you okay?"
Shota: "What do you mean?"
Chihiro: "Your face is redder than usual..."
Shota: "Isn't it just a sunburn?"
Yusaku: "Meanwhile, madam, you've been sticking with oolong tea."
Chihiro: "Ah... just for today."
Yusaku: "Is there a reason you can't drink?"
Chihiro: "N-no, just because..."
Shota: "Actually, manager..."
Chihiro: "Ah..."

A bad premonition. I quickly placed my hand on Shota's thigh. Squeeze.

Shota: "Eh?"


Chihiro: "..."
I didn't squeeze, just gently pinched. 
He must be trying to tell me about the pregnancy.
It's unlike Sho-chan to joke around like this.
Maybe he's drunker than he looks?
Yusaku: "So what's the continuation of 'Actually, Section Chief...'?"
Shota: "Um..."
Yusaku: "Speak up, will you?"
Shota: "We...actually..."
Squeeze.
Shota: "That tickles!"
Chihiro: "(Oh, no...)"
This is bad.
He's really about to spill it.
He could easily deflect with another topic.
But it seems he hesitates to do so when the person is Section Chief.
Thanks to that, I can't let go of his thigh.
I've ended up exposing the chest I've been hiding.
Yusaku: "Did you forget what you were about to say?"
Shota: "No...uh, that is..."
Yusaku: "I'll wait until you remember."
Chihiro: "..."
The devil is deliberately prolonging the conversation.
He was clearly enjoying the situation that had arisen by chance.
Shota: "Um..."
Squeeze.
Shota: "I said I get it!"
Yusaku: "Huh?"
Shota: "Ah, no, that wasn't for the Section Chief, it was..."
Yusaku: "Has the alcohol gone to your head?"
Shota: "I...I'm sorry."
Yusaku: "You have to know when enough is enough."
Chihiro: "..."
Then stop making him drink already.
Despite his words, he's pouring more beer.
Half of the amount he said he'd take home is now empty.
And all the while, the devil doesn't even look at the glass.
Ignoring my husband's presence, he's ravaging my breasts with his eyes.
It's disgusting.
The brazenness of it makes my skin crawl.
I really hate it.
I feel like if I didn't huddle up, he'd reach right into my clothes.
Yusaku: "..."
Chihiro: "..."
He's still watching.
Just staring, without blinking.
In the situation I dread most, my tension increases.
Before I knew it, most of my consciousness was stolen by my chest.
Once this happens, I can't stop.
I can't hear anything.
All I see are his snake-like eyes.
It's as if my entire body has become my breasts.
Chihiro: "Ah...!"
Why doesn't he get tired of looking?
Are they so big that he has to keep staring?
The me who was made to go shopping in this state.
What I must have looked like to others, the thought alone makes me shrink.
In reality, I passed by a few acquaintances.
I even exchanged greetings with the shopkeeper.
What if I stood out too much?


I'm so scared I haven't even looked in the mirror.
The moment I stepped outside, my mind went blank.
In retrospect, I was rash to have only thought about returning home quickly.
Chihiro: "Hic...!"
Really terrified.
I cast my eyes down to my chest.
Chihiro: "(No, no...)"
The moment I did that, I regretted it instantly.
Of course, it looked a size larger than usual.
It was too much the shape of my breasts.
But what really took my breath away came after that.
The tip of the swelling.
The nipple is sticking out so much that there's no denying it.
It stands out far more than I imagined.
Is it because I'm looking down?
The words Sho-chan told me came to mind.
"Chihiro's are small."
I think so too.
Sometimes he has to lick them to make them come out.
Even the obstetrician told me so.
"To avoid inconveniencing the baby who is breastfeeding, try to have them out as much as possible."
In other words, this is the current situation.
Even without touching them, my nipples are hard.
But since when?
Chihiro: "Ah...!"
I'm embarrassed.
Maybe the shopkeeper saw.
I don't want to anymore.
I don't want to think about it.
I want to close my legs.
I want to put on underwear.
But how?
Chihiro: "Um..."
I raised my face fearfully.
The devil is still ravishing my breasts.
He doesn't even try to catch the gaze from this side.
Chihiro: "I...need to use the...bathroom."
Yusaku: "Are you going to wash your hands in the bathroom and sneak out the bra that's in the dryer?"
Chihiro: "!!"
Yusaku: "If you're going to put on panties too, I'll give you back the ones I'm holding onto."
Chihiro: "Ah...ah..."
I doubted my own ears.
He didn't signal me with his eyes.
The words definitely came out of his mouth.
Naturally, Sho-chan, who is sitting next to me, can hear it too.
Chihiro: "Why...why would you say such a thing..."
Everything in front of me went dark.
I looked down again.
Gently, I let go of his thigh that I had been touching.
It's all over now.
All the patience I've held up to now has been wasted.
Probably, Sho-chan is so surprised that he can't utter a word.
This silence must be the calm before the storm.
"Perverted woman"
"This sow"
"Traitor"
"I never want to see your face again"
"We're getting a divorce"
"Take off your ring"
The list goes on as I think about it.
Anyway, I'm going to be showered with all kinds of abusive language.
Yusaku: "...He's asleep."
Chihiro: "..."


Yusaku: "Your husband's passed out drunk."
Chihiro: "...Huh?"
Is he asleep?
Surprised by the unexpected good news, I quickly lifted my face.
I looked at Sho-chan with a mix of doubt and hope.
Shota: "Zzz...Zzz..."
Chihiro: "..."
He really is asleep.
And he's even softly snoring.
Chihiro: "Wh, when did he...?"
Yusaku: "Didn't you notice when the conversation stopped?"
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "...Crying again, huh?"
Chihiro: "B, but you surprised me..."
Yusaku: "You really are a woman who cries a lot."
Chihiro: "Please, let me close my legs now."
Yusaku: "...What should I do?"
Chihiro: "Please... let me put on my underwear too."
Yusaku: "Well then, if you confess next to your husband, I'll let you."
Chihiro: "Co, confess?"
Yusaku: "Talk about what you did today."
Chihiro: "I, I can't..."
A wickedly cruel condition for the exchange.
I understand it all too well, even as I don't want to.
Just like the trials I've faced up till now.
I'm left with no choice but to overcome it.
Yusaku: "First, you were having a pleasant conversation with that lewd public servant."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "And then?"
Chihiro: "He...touched my butt."
Yusaku: "And then?"
Chihiro: "He said he wanted to be alone with me..."
Yusaku: "And so, you readily followed him."
Chihiro: "No, it wasn't readily, he forced me..."
Yusaku: "Is that so?"
Chihiro: "..."
I instinctively looked at Sho-chan.
Even though we're speaking in whispers, I can't help but worry about when he'll wake up.
Yusaku: "Where did he take you again?"
Chihiro: "...Behind the bathroom."
Yusaku: "What did he do to you first?"
Chihiro: "...He suddenly touched my breasts from behind."
Yusaku: "Continue."
Chihiro: "Please, I can't anymore."
Yusaku: "No, you must."
Chihiro: "If my husband hears, it will be irreversible."
Yusaku: "If you think so, you should hurry up and finish. The more time you take, the more risk you are taking."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "What happened after he touched your breasts?"
Chihiro: "He pulled down the straps of my swimsuit, then directly touched my breasts... I realized you were watching..."
Yusaku: "What did you think?"
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Yusaku: "When you realized I was there."


Chihiro: "Of course, I was embarrassed."
Yusaku: "So that's why you got wet?"
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Please don't say things like that.
Sho-chan is right next to us.
My heart pounds at the words that stir up guilt.
Shame and agitation combine, turning my cheeks as red as autumn leaves.
Chihiro: "Speaking about that here is..."
Yusaku: "Hehe..."
Chihiro: "..."
What a despicable person.
This devil just wants to see me struggle.
That's why he keeps pressing on my weaknesses.
Of course, I'm also saddened by my inability to fully deny it.
The reason I got wet is still unclear.
But I remember exactly when I started feeling uncomfortable.
His gaze, cold as a snake's, then too.
My body started to squirm right after he turned those eyes on me.
Despite the fact that it was that old man touching me.
Most of my consciousness was on the devil.
His faint smile that always made me feel nauseous.
Especially his gesture of peeking from behind something, I really hated that.
Chihiro: "...?"
Hate?
Does hate make me wet?
I immediately cut off my self-questioning, self-answering.
Avoiding deep thought, I tried to return my mind to its original track.
Chihiro: "Then, I grabbed his... penis."
Yusaku: "...That's quite abrupt."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Wasn't there another event before that?"
Chihiro: "He almost threw the ring..."
Yusaku: "That was right before you stroked his cock, right?"
Chihiro: "Yes, yes it was."
Yusaku: "Rewind a bit more."
Chihiro: "..."
I know.
About the peeing.
Yusaku: "Something was trickling out, wasn't it?"
Chihiro: "I... leaked."
Yusaku: "What did you leak?"
Chihiro: "...Pee."
Yusaku: "Did you wet yourself because it felt good?"
Chihiro: "No. I was scared, and so..."
Yusaku: "You've been scared many times before."
Chihiro: "But that time, I truly thought I was going to be violated..."
Yusaku: "I see..."
Chihiro: "..."
I'm not lying.
To be honest, there's another reason why I wet myself.
But when dealing with this devil, everything becomes more timid.
I even hesitate to explain properly.
But...
Being thought of as aroused is even worse.
Absolutely unacceptable.
Chihiro: "...I had been holding it in for a while before."
Yusaku: "Speak clearly so I can understand."


Chihiro: "I, I was holding in my pee for a while."
Yusaku: "Huh..."
Chihiro: "Ah... h-hic..."
No.
For some reason, I feel a tightness around my belly button.
I distract myself by taking a sip from my glass of Oolong tea.
But the strange sensation doesn't go away.
Yusaku: "Since you were talking to the perverted bureaucrat?"
Chihiro: "...Yes."
Yusaku: "You could have excused yourself and gone to the bathroom."
Chihiro: "You wouldn't allow it."
Yusaku: "Why would you think that?"
Chihiro: "It's clear from your attitude up to that point."
Yusaku: "I said not to contradict me without good reason, but I never said you couldn't go to the toilet."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "Hehe..."
Don't look at me like that.
I didn't want to hold it in.
Yusaku: "A wife with a bladder filled to the brim with pee, huh."
Chihiro: "Please, don't phrase it like that."
Yusaku: "You're just a normal person, too."
Chihiro: "So, it's wrong for an ugly woman to hold in her pee?"
Yusaku: "No one said that."
Chihiro: "But, but..."
Yusaku: "How did you feel when you wet yourself?"
Chihiro: "Hic... hic... sob..."
Pervert.
Meanie.
Chihiro: "You don't need to ask that."
Yusaku: "I want to hear it from your mouth."
Chihiro: "It was... embarrassing..."
Yusaku: "Embarrassing?"
Chihiro: "I felt... pitiful..."
Yusaku: "Pitiful?"
Chihiro: "Sob..."
I can't say anymore.
My voice gradually gets smaller.
Finally, with my face reddened, I just keep my head down.
All I can do is mumble.
Yusaku: "Can't be helped."
With those words, the devil sprawls out.
Scratching his nose, he alternates between looking at my face and my breasts.
Yusaku: "Apologize to your husband, then I'll stop this conversation."
Chihiro: "He's asleep."
Yusaku: "If he was awake, you wouldn't be able to apologize, would you?"
Chihiro: "..."
That's true.
That's why I can't argue back.
Yusaku: "Come on, look at your husband..."
Shota: "Zzz... Zzz..."
Chihiro: "..."
Yusaku: "Speak to him."
Chihiro: "But, but..."
Yusaku: "If you don't want to, you'll be pantyless and braless forever."
Chihiro: "Ah..."


Yusaku: "Let's start."
Chihiro: "Um, Shota-kun..."
Yusaku: "...Nice."
This is ridiculous.
The exaggerated tone is incredibly embarrassing.
Chihiro: "I... I was almost violated behind the toilet. I was scared, so I wet myself... I'm sorry."
Yusaku: "...Continue the story."
Chihiro: "Then, I grabbed his... penis."
Yusaku: "Report who it was."
Chihiro: "I grabbed the penis of the man... the one I entertained."
Yusaku: "...And what did you do?"
Chihiro: "I... I stroked it until he ejaculated."
Shota: "Zzz... Zzz..."
Chihiro: "..."
Shota is lying face down on the table.
As I stare at his profile, I'm saying unbelievable things.
Yusaku: "...You passed."
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Yusaku: "As promised, you can do as you please. Wear underwear or whatever you like."
Chihiro: "..."
Surprised by the anticlimactic ending.
I thought I would have to talk about more things.
But it's okay.
A day that felt extraordinarily long.
Finally, I'm released from the devil's gaze.
I close my legs that were spread apart.
I pull the chair and try to stand up.
Chihiro: "Ah...eh...?"
My knees won't extend.
Did they stiffen because I was in the same position for too long?
Yusaku: "What's wrong?"
Chihiro: "No, nothing..."
The devil, still seated as always.
He was grinning as he looked at my face.
Chihiro: "(Alright, here goes)"
All my strength.
I put both hands on the table.
Not minding my breasts shaking, I push myself up with all my might.
The chair shakes.
It's as difficult as a toddler's first steps.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
An earthquake?
The dizziness is so severe I could mistake it for that.
The moment I stood up, the ceiling started spinning.
Something's wrong.
This is strange.
Chihiro: "Ah...!"
My knees buckle again.
It's like all my bones have disappeared.
In a hurry, I grab the edge of the table.
I barely manage to support my squatting body.
But the dizziness doesn't stop.
It feels like I'm on a boat in rough seas.
Before I know it, someone's hand is on my shoulder.
Shota?
No.
Shota's asleep.
I don't know what's happening anymore.
Help me.
Help.
Hel...p...
...
...
...
