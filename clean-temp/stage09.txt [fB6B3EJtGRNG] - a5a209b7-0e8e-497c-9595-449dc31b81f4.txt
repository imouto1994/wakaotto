...The next day...
Yusaku: "Hey, Akizuki!!"
Shota: "Y-yes, Chief Kazama."
Yusaku: "...An empty lunch box."
Shota: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "Tell your wife 'thanks for the meal' for me."
Shota: "O-okay."
Yusaku: "Puhah... guh..."
Shota: "...!"
Yusaku: "...Did you need something from me?"
Shota: "Y-yes, um..."
Yusaku: "...What is it?"
Shota: "No... it's... nothing..."
Yusaku: "You must have been busy yesterday, huh?"
Shota: "Huh?"
Yusaku: "You were inspecting the new government housing."
Shota: "I was nervous doing it alone, but somehow..."
Yusaku: "The guys from the Civil Engineering Section were praising you."
Shota: "R-really?"
Yusaku: "They seemed impressed with the documentation you put together."
Shota: "Ah, thank you."
Yusaku: "Keep up the good work. You're the hope of the Budget Compilation Section."
Shota: "Yes, I'll do my best to be useful."
Yusaku: "Heh..."
Did you really want to ask about the lunch box?
Of course you did.
Your beloved wife made it, even for your boss.
But you don't have to worry.
You just play the mediator between me and Chihiro.
Thanks to that, I got it properly.
It's like the resignation in your wife's eyes.
But if you're going to do it, you might as well aim for perfection.
Your only show of resistance.
The contents of the lunch box are almost the same.
I realized it when I had him taste it before eating.
Yusaku: "Hmph..."
Well, that's fine.
It's just like your wife.
At first, just as she was told, only mine was extravagant.
But her conscience wouldn't allow it.
Comparing the contents of her beloved husband's lunch box.
In the end, they were almost identical.
I can see it in my head.
You, sighing as you close the lid.
You were prepared to be scolded by me, weren't you?
Don't worry.
I have a proper return gift prepared.
A dark fantasy I thought up in the infirmary.
I'll give you a humiliation beyond what you've experienced so far....
...
...
...
Receptionist: "Ms. Akizuki."
Chihiro: "Y-yes..."
Receptionist: "Please come in."
Chihiro: "..."
A little nervous.
Wipes her sweaty palms on her jeans.
Then quietly opens the door to the examination room.
Male Obstetrician: "Let's see..."
The doctor, still looking at the medical chart.
He's not looking at me.


Urged by the nurse, I sit down on the round chair in front of me.
Chihiro: "...How is it?"
Male Obstetrician: "Looking at the results of your urine test, it seems you are pregnant."
Chihiro: "..."
I didn't know how to react.
Should I smile brightly?
Should I just nod?
Male Obstetrician: "Eight days past your expected period..."
Chihiro: "...Yes."
Male Obstetrician: "Normally, I'd like to wait and see a bit more, but in your case, you've been coming here regularly..."
Male Obstetrician: "Considering the results of the urine test, you can pretty much be sure... Congratulations."
Chihiro: "Ah, thank you..."
Male Obstetrician: "You may have some anxieties unique to your first pregnancy, but your body will adapt properly. So, you don't have to worry."
Chihiro: "..."
Don't worry, it's fine.
The doctor, looking at me for the first time.
His face is smiling brightly.
White clothes.
White teeth.
His hair is cut short.
He looks very clean.
I'm glad.
A reputable hospital indeed.
Male Obstetrician: "Shall we proceed with the examination?"
Chihiro: "Huh?"
Male Obstetrician: "..."
No further explanation.
He shifts his gaze back to the medical chart.
Nurse: "Please come this way."
The nurse approaches me to take over.
She expertly guides me behind the curtain.
Of course, this is expected.
It's a path everyone takes to give birth.
Nurse: "Please remove your underwear and place your feet on the table. You can keep your clothes on."
Chihiro: "Y-yes."
The sound of the curtain closing.
I loosen my belt.
I neatly fold my jeans.
I slip my underwear into the gap.
I gently place it in the laundry basket.
Chihiro: "Ah...!"
The cool examination table.
First, I take a breather sitting in a gymnasium-style seat.
Then, I put my right foot in the U-shaped part.
Followed by my left foot.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
What an incredible position.
Even if it's inevitable, it's certainly embarrassing.
The old me might not have been able to do this.
A little courage to do this.
Probably because I didn't even have that.
Chihiro: "Phew..."
The strangeness of being here.
Looking at the pure white ceiling, I really think about that.
When I went outside, I had no destination.


I just didn't want to be alone in that room.
Without thinking, I casually wandered to the next town.
Before I knew it, I had ended up at this hospital.
But while waiting for the test results in the waiting room.
The blurred reason became gradually clear.
Chihiro: "..."
Another choice I shouldn't make.
Perhaps, to prevent that, I am here.
Male Obstetrician: "I will move the curtain."
Chihiro: "Ah... Y-yes... go ahead..."
I was a little surprised at the sudden voice.
But the incredibly soft tone reassures me.
Consideration for me, a first-time mother.
It came across more than words could convey.
I'm okay now.
I don't mind being seen by this doctor.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Male Obstetrician: "Please relax."
Chihiro: "I-I'll try my best."
Male Obstetrician: "Try your best?"
Chihiro: "Try to relax..."
Male Obstetrician: "...I see."
Oh no.
I'm saying weird things.
It must be because I'm nervous.
The sensation of my legs tensing up.
It seems more strength is going into it than I realize.
I need to relax.
Squeeze...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
The sound of putting on rubber gloves.
Right after, the doctor touches me.
My private area.
He's spreading the entrance to my vagina with his fingers.
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
I take back my initial word.
It's embarrassing after all.
Male Obstetrician: "I'll wipe a bit with cotton wool."
Chihiro: "Y-yes."
Could it be dirty?
Or is there a strange smell?
No.
That can't be.
I took a shower five times from yesterday to this morning.
Of course, I made sure before I left...
Male Obstetrician: "Tell me if it hurts."
Squeeze...push...
Chihiro: "Ah..."
The clinking of metal.
Something cold is entering my vagina.
At first, it's flat and extremely smooth.
But the deeper it goes, the more resistance I feel.
Could it be shaped like a crocodile's mouth?
It must be.
Male Obstetrician: "...Relax your body."
Chihiro: "Y-yes."
Squeak, squeak, squeak.
This time it sounds like a screw being turned.
Because I'm tense, that sound is particularly noticeable.
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
Male Obstetrician: "Are you okay?"
Chihiro: "I'm... fine..."
Actually, it hurt a little.
But I'll endure it.
I don't want the doctor to dislike me.
Right now, I don't want to lose an ally.
Squeak... squeak... squeak...
Squeak... squeak... squeak...


Chihiro: "Hi...u...h..."
I'm being slowly dilated.
Not just at the entrance, but all the way inside.
The sensation of the mucous membrane coming into direct contact with the air.
I hate how easily I can imagine what's happening.
Male Obstetrician: "Please stay still."
Chihiro: "Y-yes, I understand."
The doctor sits down on the chair.
His face is right near my private area.
I can vaguely sense his movements from the shift in the air.
Male Obstetrician: "Hmm..."
Chihiro: "..."
Male Obstetrician: "..."
Chihiro: "Ugh...k...h..."
I'm being peeked at.
The inside of my body.
My vagina, spread out like a cave.
Chihiro: "Ah...u..."
I mustn't fidget.
It's much better compared to yesterday.
The person is a clean and respectable doctor.
Completely different from that dirty chief.
Male Obstetrician: "We're almost done."
Chihiro: "Y-yes."
After that demon left.
I cried until my tears ran dry.
Right until Shou was about to come home.
But the moment I opened the front door and saw his face.
I realized I had one thing to lean on.
Chihiro: "(I wasn't violated...)"
I've been repeating this phrase ever since.
At first, to comfort myself.
Now, to not lose sight of the light of hope.
The fact that I wasn't violated is a blessing in disguise.
I should be preserving my chastity by a hair's breadth.
That large penis.
If it entered me, it wouldn't end simply.
The mental damage would be more than now.
My precious part would surely tear.
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
I shudder just thinking about it.
The stamina when he made me do it with my mouth.
Because I remembered that.
The chief's veiny penis.
Me, being rubbed rough by that thickness.
It would probably be so painful I might faint.
But that's what the demon would do.
No matter how much I cry and scream, he wouldn't stop.
10 minutes, 20 minutes.
Maybe it would even continue for 30 minutes.
If I went through that, even a pregnancy test would be impossible.
Swelling from excessive friction.
A genital that screams 'we had rough sex.'
Chihiro: "..."
No.
I couldn't show the doctor out of embarrassment.
Male Obstetrician: "Oops..."
Chihiro: "Eh?"
Male Obstetrician: "Let's wipe once more."
Chihiro: "...?"
A silver, shiny pair of tweezers.
I caught a glimpse of it through the gap in the swaying curtain.


The tip holds a pure white cotton swab.
It traces my private area.
Chihiro: "..."
It's a bit similar.
To the sensation when the chief licked me.
But I mustn't remember it.
I promised myself I would erase it from my memory.
Male Obstetrician: "You've never had any sexually transmitted diseases, right?"
Chihiro: "Eh?"
Male Obstetrician: "Have you ever felt anything unusual in the past?"
Chihiro: "N-no, not particularly..."
Male Obstetrician: "Hmm..."
Chihiro: "..."
I wonder what's going on.
I'm starting to feel uneasy.
Chihiro: "Um..."
Male Obstetrician: "Yes."
Chihiro: "Is there something you're concerned about...?"
Male Obstetrician: "Do you normally have a lot of discharge?"
Chihiro: "N-no..."
Male Obstetrician: "Then, it might be an early sign of pregnancy."
I felt a jolt.
Chihiro: "Ugh..."
My navel area feels itchy.
The movement of the tweezers continues uninterrupted.
With each back-and-forth, the cotton swab gets damp.
I was stunned by that overly obscene sensation.
Could it be that I'm wet?
And in a place like this?
Male Obstetrician: "I'll remove the speculum now."
Chihiro: "Y-yes..."
It slips out easily.
Chihiro: "Hmm..."
There's no resistance.
It falls out as if sliding on its own.
I'm definitely wet.
And it's not just a little.
I'm blushing all the way to my ears.
If possible, I want to wipe it vigorously myself.
Male Obstetrician: "A new cotton swab..."
Nurse: "Did we run out already?"
Male Obstetrician: "You don't need to say unnecessary things."
Nurse: "...I'm sorry."
Chihiro: "Um..."
Male Obstetrician: "Please wait a moment."
Chihiro: "I-I'll handle it myself..."
Male Obstetrician: "We need to properly treat it."
Chihiro: "Really, I-I can, really..."
Male Obstetrician: "..."
A moment of silence.
Male Obstetrician: "Well, shall we put a pad on? Otherwise, I think your underwear will get 'that'."
'That' underwear.
Meaning it's going to get wet.
Male Obstetrician: "Then, this."
Through the gap in the curtain, the doctor's hand.
He gently places something like a large bandage on my lower abdomen.
Male Obstetrician: "You can put your underwear back on now."
Chihiro: "Y-yes...I'm...sorry..."
I speak in a barely audible voice.


I shrink and get off the examination table.
I hurriedly put on my underwear without the pad.
It's fine because I'm wearing jeans.
No matter what's happening down there, I'm ignoring it now.
I don't want to sigh miserably here.
I can do that once I get home.
Chihiro: "Kuh..."
I purposely tighten my belt.
I figured that putting strain on my body would help me feign composure.
Then, I return the laundry basket to its place.
I check my clothes and take a small deep breath.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
It was when I looked around one last time to make sure I hadn't forgotten anything.
I notice the small trash can next to the examination table.
Surprised.
It's half filled with damp cotton swabs.
All of it, mine?
The nurse's words replay in my head.
"Did we run out already?"
It's an amount that would be surprising.
There are even ones that would drop if picked up.
Chihiro: "(Ah...)"
What should I do?
I'm sure the doctor has misunderstood.
He must think that I was feeling strange.
His talk about diseases and discharge was just out of consideration.
"Please don't get too excited."
If the doctor wasn't kind, I would surely be told that.
The nurse giggles at those words.
My medical chart might be written with "lewd wet woman".
How embarrassing.
If there was a hole, I would want to hide in it.
I stand still in the partitioned space.
Unable to move.
Unable to open the curtain.
Not a fragment of courage springs forth...

...Later that day, at 11 PM...
Ding-dong.
Chihiro: "Welcome home."
Shota: "...I'm back."
Chihiro: "You were late today, too."
Shota: "Yeah."
Chihiro: "..."
He loosens his tie and heads to the living room.
He seems a bit off.
He was out until midnight yesterday too, so he must be tired.
Chihiro: "Do you want to take a bath first?"
Shota: "Before that..."
Chihiro: "...?"
Shota: "Actually, it's about this."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
The paper bag he held out.
The one I put two lunch boxes in and handed to Shota.
Shota: "The chief said thank you."
Chihiro: "S-so."
Shota: "Are you going to make one for Monday too?"
Chihiro: "N-no..."
Shota: "Just for today?"
Chihiro: "Probably..."
Shota: "Because you're always grateful to him?"
Chihiro: "Eh?"
Shota: "You said that when you gave me this paper bag, didn't you?"


Chihiro: "W-well... yeah."
Shota: "But why a lunch box?"
Chihiro: "I couldn't think of anything else..."
Shota: "So, for you, homemade means something you do when you can't think of anything else."
Chihiro: "N-not necessarily..."
Shota: "This isn't good."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Shota: "I thought about it when I handed it to the section chief. I casually accepted it this morning, but as lunch approached, I started to feel bad..."
Chihiro: "I... I'm sorry."
Shota: "Of course, I don't think you meant any harm... but you are my wife, Chihiro."
Squeeze.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Shota hugs me tightly.
I just shrink in apology.
Shota: "..."
Chihiro: "I'm sorry..."
Shota: "Yeah."
Chihiro: "I'm... really... sorry..."
Shota: "As long as you understand."
I feel like crying.
But I won't cry.
Because that's unfair.
I keep apologizing in my heart.
I cling tightly to Shota, hoping he can feel even a bit of it.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
What's happening?
My body is tingling.
I'm so excited.
Not just me, he is too.
He's quickly gotten hard.
I realize we haven't done it in about 10 days.
This is the longest we've gone without since we got married.
Chihiro: "H-hey..."
Shota: "Hmm?"
Chihiro: "Ah..."
My face is hot.
My heart is pounding.
I feel like I'm about to say something crazy.
Shota: "What?"
Chihiro: "I... I want to... have sex..."
Shota: "..."
Chihiro: "..."
I can't see his face.
But he seems surprised.
It's the first time I've ever initiated.
Shota: "R-right now?"
Chihiro: "If... if you're okay with it, Shota."
Shota: "I... I don't mind at all..."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
The moment I finish speaking, a storm of kisses.
He breathes passionate breaths onto every exposed part of my skin.
Shota is unbelievably excited.
I've never seen him like this before.
Is it because of the lunch box?
Or is it because I initiated for the first time?
Chihiro: "Ah... don't..."
Suddenly, his arm is under my skirt.
He roughly fondles my precious part.
I'm simply happy.
That I still have the right to be touched this way.
Shota: "Ch...Chihiro..."
Chihiro: "Ah... not... not so suddenly... stop..."


I was pinned against the kitchen sink.
Then my skirt was lifted high up.
From behind? In a position we haven't done since it hurt me last time?
Chihiro: "S-Shota..."
Shota: "Huff... huff... huff... haa..."
Chihiro: "Ah, don't be too rough..."
Shota: "I... I'm going to ravish you."
Chihiro: "No... don't say things like that..."
No.
No matter it's Shota, it's a bit scary.
He's a little too excited.
If he thrusts into me with this momentum, it'll be intense.
Surely the baby would be surprised.
I was really planning to talk about it during dinner.
The timing is strange, but I have to tell him first.
Chihiro: "Um, you know..."
Shota: "Haa... haa... haa... haa..."
Chihiro: "Ah, are you listening?"
Slip.
Chihiro: "Kyaa!"
My underwear was pulled down to my knees.
The living room lights are still on.
Shota can probably see all the way to my backside.
Chihiro: "Wait..."
Shota: "No."
Chihiro: "Ah, actually, I went to the obstetrician today..."
Shota: "Huh?"
Shota's movements stop abruptly.
Chihiro: "...It's confirmed."
Shota: "What is?"
Chihiro: "I... It seems I'm pregnant..."
Shota: "..."
Chihiro: "..."
This time, not only his movements but his breath also stopped.
Shota: "...Se-seriously?"
Chihiro: "Y-yes..."
I nervously await his next words.
Squeeze.
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Shota: "We did it, didn't we."
Chihiro: "..."
I'm hugged again.
Much gentler than before.
Shota: "We did it, we did it."
Chihiro: "Is... is it okay?"
Shota: "What is?"
Chihiro: "So, about the baby..."
Shota: "Of course it's okay."
Chihiro: "But Shota, you said it was too soon... before..."
Shota: "It's a gift from God, isn't it?"
Chihiro: "Ah..."
I can't anymore.
Now the tears won't stop.
Shota: "Is it a boy, is it a girl."
Chihiro: "We... we don't know that yet..."
Shota: "I'll help with anything, so don't hesitate to ask."
Chihiro: "Y-yes... sniff... thank... you..."
Shota: "Let's go buy baby clothes tomorrow."
Chihiro: "...Even though we don't know if it's a boy or a girl?"


Shota: "Then, I guess I'll stop by the store on the way back. I'm already being called by the section chief, so I'll just drop by on my way home."
Chihiro: "!?"
My body froze.
Being summoned by that devil?
Stop joking on such a day.
The tears welling up in my eyes are about to take on a different meaning.
Chihiro: "You're working even though it's Sunday?"
Shota: "Hmm, I'm not sure if it's work or not. But he said it wouldn't take long, so I think I'll be back soon."
Chihiro: "..."
Shota: "I wonder if I should report it to Section Chief Sama."
Chihiro: "About the baby?"
Shota: "Yeah."
Chihiro: "No, you can't."
Shota: "..."
I shouldn't have.
I unintentionally raised my voice.
Chihiro: "...I think it's okay to wait a little longer."
Shota: "If Chihiro says so... I'll keep it a secret for now..."
Chihiro: "...I'm sorry."
Shota: "You don't have to apologize for that. I feel like I'm being apologized to along with the baby."
Chihiro: "...?"
Shota was humming.
He loosened his tie and started to undress.
His suit usually left on the table.
Yet for some reason he's hanging it up on a hanger himself.
Chihiro: "I'll do it, so just leave it..."
Shota: "No."
Chihiro: "Why?"
Shota: "Because it's bad for your precious body."
Chihiro: "I'm still fine and normal now. That's what the doctor said, too."
Shota: "Still, no."
Chihiro: "..."
Shota, now in only his underwear.
He cheerfully places his bag in its usual spot.
His removed socks are in the washing machine.
He's moving around by himself, not letting me do anything.
Shota: "I'm going to take a bath."
Chihiro: "..."
Chihiro: "...Huh?"
He's gone.
What about sex?
Could it be after he gets out of the bath?
Chihiro: "..."
My underwear is still down to my knees under my skirt.
I rustle it back into place with my own hands.
Chihiro: "...Sigh."
I'm feeling a little lonely.
But it can't be helped.
I'm the one who threw a wet blanket on things.
It must have been an unexpected story for him.
Shota, who was able to share in the joy.
For now, I just have to be thankful for that...
...
Chihiro: "..."
Just before midnight.
Shota is already deep in dreamland.
After he got out of the bath, he gently kissed my cheek.
He ate and then immediately slipped into the futon.


Even though it's fine to have normal sex until morning sickness starts.
Somehow, I feel awkwardly concerned.
Chihiro: "Sigh…"
Thanks to that, my body is still restless.
The sensation of being held won't fade.
What would have happened if I hadn't told anything?
I, who was roughly pinned to the sink.
Surely he would have put his penis in me right then.
Shota was very excited.
Of course, I felt the same way.
"...I...want to...have sex..."
Words I've uttered for the first time.
I wanted him to hold me that much.
If it weren't for the baby, I wouldn't mind from behind.
Even if it hurts, it's okay.
I want him to mess me up so much that I forget about the unpleasant things.
I really thought that.
What's troublesome is that it hasn't changed even now.
That's why I mix water into the hot water.
I'm desperately trying to cool down my frustrated body.
Chihiro: "Phew…"
Something's strange.
I'm clearly weird today.
I'm in a ridiculously horny mood.
If excuses are okay, there are plenty of explanations.
It's because I haven't had sex for almost ten days.
Some people have a stronger libido in early pregnancy.
Even the fact that I wanted to be held by him.
Or maybe because I want the last person who touched me to be Shota.
The humiliation given by the section chief.
Something that won't come off no matter how much I wash.
I want to erase that.
Chihiro: "..."
But what will I do when it's erased?
The nightmare isn't over yet.
I'll be defiled again anyway.
Using that picture shown at the entrance.
The harassment escalates more and more.
At worst, with that grotesque penis…
I clenched.
Chihiro: "No, no..."
My lower abdomen contracted sharply.
I instinctively squatted down on my shaking knees.
I squirm for a while.
I can't muster the strength to stand up.
Chihiro: "Ugh…Kuh…"
A bad premonition.
Could it be again?
To prevent bacteria from entering, I washed my hands well with soap.
Then, I timidly put my finger towards my private parts.
It's slimy.
Chihiro: "Ah…"
Enough already.
I'm wet again.
Even though I just washed.
Like an undisciplined dog.
Drooling indiscriminately.
I feel anger beyond embarrassment.
Enough already.
Even after being molested.
Even when I went to the doctor.
Please, don't get wet on your own.
What do you want me to do?
What do I have to do to stay normal?


If I could, I'd like to plug this hateful hole.
Nup…
Chihiro: "Ugh…"
Just with a little force.
Yet, my middle finger was easily sucked in.
About twice as deep as when I usually wash.
The inside of me that I'm touching for the first time.
I've never put it in this deep.
It's much rougher than near the entrance.
But why is it?
Doing this, the restlessness fades.
Twitch…
Chihiro: "Ah…"
A sweet, numbing sensation.
I hastily pull out my finger.
Chihiro: "Ah…"
I'm surprised.
Probably because my palm touched my clitoris.
Usually, I don't even feel its existence.
But it was strangely perky.
Twitch…Throb…
Chihiro: "Ah…Ugh…"
It's hard after all.
It's gritty.
Strange.
But strangely enough, it seems like I could forget about the unpleasant things.
The nauseating throbbing is gone.
Chihiro: "Mmm…Ah…"
Wait.
What am I doing?
I can't do something strange.
This kind of thing is not good.
It's not fair to Shota.
Chihiro: "Ah…Ha…Ah…"
Even though I think so, my finger doesn't stop moving.
I even start to think that I, who am tormenting myself, am hypocritical.
A woman who has been humiliated over and over again by a man she doesn't even like.
And in the end, I even wet myself.
Chihiro: "Ah…Ha…Ugh…Ha…"
Yes.
That man drank my pee.
He gulped down something that should have been flushed down the toilet.
Unbelievable.
Just remembering it makes me nauseous.
It's more than just abnormal.
But if he went that far...
A question that keeps coming up and disappearing.
Why didn't he rape me on the spot?
We were alone in the room.
With a man's strength, it should be easy to pin me down.
But he didn't.
He satisfied his own sexual desire.
Because my pussy is dirty?
Or am I not enough of a woman to rape?
Throb…
Chihiro: "Hi…ku…uh…"
I found it.
The place that devil persistently tormented.
Near the base of the clitoris, closer to the vaginal side.
When I touch here, my lower abdomen goes numb.
A sweet sensation gradually spreads.
I didn't know I had such a place.
Yet, somehow that devil knows.
More than I do, for some reason.
Twitch…Ugh…
Chihiro: "Mmm…"
No, no.
I let out a slightly loud voice.
I have to be careful.
If someone in the neighborhood heard, I'd really be embarrassed.
Twitch…Twitch…


Chihiro: "Mmm... Ah... Ha... Mmm..."
Throb, throb.
Chihiro: "Ah… Ah… Mmm… Ha… Mmm… Mmm… Shota..."
If I keep playing with myself like this, will I reach climax?
Probably so.
I'm going to cum.
Squish... Slurp... Throb...
Chihiro: "Mmm... Kuu..."
Squish… Squish… Throb… Throb…
Chihiro: "Ku… Ugh… Ah…"
Throb…
Chihiro: "Ah… Ah… Ha… Ha… Mmm… Ha… Ha…"
Chihiro: "Mmm... Kuu... Ha, ha... Ah... Mmm... Ha... Ugh... Ah... Mmm... Mmm... Ha... Ha... Ha..."
It feels good.
But I will never do something like this again.
Doing it myself is a first and last.
I promise.
So please forgive me just this once.
Throb... Squeeze...
Chihiro: "Ah… Ugh… Ha… Ah…"
The finger I buried back inside.
Each time I play with my clitoris, the path narrows.
It feels tight even with this thickness.
I finally understood what Shota always said when we were having sex.
Chihiro is tight.
I don't know who he's comparing me to.
But I don't want to ask about the time before we started dating.
I'm scared of myself getting terribly jealous.
Chihiro: "Mmm… Mmm…"
I'm about to cum.
I have to think about Shota's face.
That's the least I can do to atone for my sins.
Throb… Throb… Throb…
Chihiro: "Ku… Ha… Ah…"
I'm cumming.
But it's small.
So small that I feel silly for bracing myself.
I was playing with the same spot.
Yet the pleasure is like a tiny pea.
On the other hand, the guilt is not half-hearted.
It grows like an endless balloon, contrary to the subsiding sweet waves.
Nup...
Chihiro: "Ah… Ha…"
I pull my finger out of my vagina.
I wash off the slimy part with all my might.
I won't do it again.
I definitely won't do such a thing.
I'm an idiot.
Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot...
…
Chihiro: "…"
The quiet living room.
The first thing I look at is the sliding door of the Japanese-style room.
Shota's snoring that shouldn't be audible.
I try to confirm that before anything else.
Like a child who has just played a prank.
I was shivering alone with guilt.
Chihiro: "Ah…"
I messed up.
The paper bag left in the kitchen.
It's still as Shota brought it home.
Because of my disgust, I naturally put off cleaning up.
Of course, not his lunch box, but the devil's.


Chihiro: "I don't want to touch anything that's been touched by his saliva. But on the other hand, I'm glad. I can't just go to Shou-chan's side right after doing such a thing in the bathroom. I need to cool down my sense of guilt. ..."

Chihiro: "..."

The lunch box that I took out of the bag. One is empty. The other is about half left. Needless to say, the one left uneaten is Shou-chan's. The reason is obvious. Probably because he was shocked by what I did.

Chihiro: "Ah..."

No. Rather than cooling down, my guilt is swelling. He did nothing wrong, yet I've reduced even his appetite. The devil who ate all his food disgusts me. I thought I might just throw it away without washing. For a moment, I was about to put it into the non-burnable garbage bag. But I withdrew. It's best not to do anything extra. It could give Shou-chan a new question.

Chihiro: "Haa..."

First, I carefully washed the familiar chopsticks of Shou-chan's lunch box that I could wash with ease. Then, the devil's turn. I cleansed my hands with soap. I even put on rubber gloves. Fully protected. Because I don't have the courage to open the lid otherwise.

Chihiro: "...?"

What's this?

Inside the lunch box, there are disposable chopsticks that have been folded in half. There's some kind of paper wrapped around them. Through the oil-stained part, I can see the characters. "Thank you for the meal" If that's what's written, I feel like I'll get goosebumps.

Chihiro: "Ugh..."

Frustrating. Because it's indirect, I can't unfold the paper well. I have no choice but to remove the gloves. Then, as if touching something dirty, I picked it up with the tip of my fingers. I opened the folded paper with just the part of my nails.

Chihiro: "Ah..."

What assaulted me was not disgust, but a shudder. "Tomorrow, noon, my house, come" A creepy sentence. A reminder for Shou-chan? No. It's not him who should see this. The fact that it's deliberately vague is proof of that. It's avoiding the risk of someone other than me seeing it. "Come to my room at noon tomorrow" This is the message for me. Are you saying with Shou-chan? I don't know. I didn't hear the time of the promise he made. What on earth? What does it mean? My heart beats fast in fear. My fingertips start to tremble with rising anxiety.

Chihiro: "..."

Surely, it's a punishment. Because I did such a thing in the bathroom. I'm sorry. I won't do it anymore. So please. Protect me and Shou-chan from that devil. I don't want to do this anymore.


I don't want to be subjected to something terrible. Really, really, I don't want to...
