Koufukugaoka City Hall, Finance Bureau, Budget Planning Division
Zama Yusaku: "Heey, Akizuki!!"
...
Akizuki Shota: "Y-Yes, Section Chief Zama."
Yusaku: "You're too fucking slow, you dullard."
Shota: "I-I'm sorry."
Yusaku: "So, on top of being slow, you can't even do your job properly. Who the hell told you to organize the documents by gender?"
Shota: "Oh, um, you did, Section Chief... I thought..."
Yusaku: "...Hah?"
Shota: "Gh..."
Yusaku: "...If you have an opinion, I might just hear you out."
Shota: "N-No... nothing..."
Yusaku: "Good grief. In a government office, seniority is the golden rule, isn't it? Not by gender, not by ability, but by age. Age!"
Shota: "...I will remake them immediately."
Yusaku: "Get it together... Assistant Section Chief."
Shota: "Y-Yes."
Yusaku: "Are you so fresh from your honeymoon that your brain is nothing but pink mush?"
Shota: "Gh... That's not..."
Yusaku: "Then redo it today. If you can't finish it today, you'll work all night until it's done... got it?"
Shota: "U-Understood."

*Ding-dong.*
[Akizuki Chihiro] Yees.
Shota: "I'm home."
Chihiro: "Welcome back, Sho-chan. You're late again today."
Shota: "Sigh..."
Chihiro: "Are you pretty tired?"
Shota: "Mentally..."
Chihiro: "Is that Section Chief the cause again?"
Shota: "Yeah... well..."
Chihiro: "I'll listen to your complaints. But first, let's take a bath. Come on."
...
*Rub rub.*
*Rub rub rub.*
Shota: "..."
Chihiro: "Did you lose a little weight again?"
Shota: "Maybe."
Chihiro: "You've been leaving leftovers in your bento a lot lately, so I just thought it was summer fatigue, but..."
Shota: "Ever since I became Assistant Section Chief, my appetite has plummeted."
Chihiro: "...Section Chief Zama, was it?"
Shota: "Yeah."
Chihiro: "If I recall, his father is the Human Resources Director."
Shota: "He got in through his father's connections originally, so yeah, it's..."
Chihiro: "Is he bossy?"
Shota: "More than just bossy, it feels like he does whatever he pleases."
Chihiro: "...That's rough."
Shota: "That's why I was late again today. Even though I did exactly as instructed, he blamed his own misspeaking on me..."
Chihiro: "..."
My poor Sho-chan.
Hang in there.
I'm with you.
Chihiro: "Hey..."
Shota: "Hm?"
Let's do our best
You can quit if it's too hard
Chihiro: "Let's do our best."
Shota: "...I know."
Chihiro: "You can overcome this, Sho-chan. You might even become friends with Section Chief Zama eventually."
Chihiro: "You can quit if it's too hard."
Shota: "...R-Really?"
Chihiro: "Because no matter what happens, I'll follow you, Sho-chan. I'm a housewife now, but I can go back to work."
Shota: "..."
Chihiro: "If you lose one more kilo, let's just quit."
Shota: "...I'll work hard, so it's okay."
Chihiro: "I'm telling you, you don't have to force yourself."
Shota: "If I quit so easily, it would be bad for the teacher who recommended me, right?"
Chihiro: "I'll apologize with you."
Shota: "Besides, the only reason your parents approved was because I'm a steady civil servant..."
Chihiro: "Once we're married, that doesn't matter anymore."
Shota: "A-Anyway, I'll continue working at City Hall. If I get discouraged by something like this, I won't be useful anywhere I work."
Chihiro: "I thought you'd say that."
Shota: "...Eh?"
Chihiro: "I think you can definitely overcome this, Sho-chan. You might even become friends with Section Chief Zama eventually."
Shota: "...If I think of it that way, this might be a good chance."
Chihiro: "For what?"
Shota: "It's sudden and I feel bad, but... he says he wants to come to our house tomorrow night."
Chihiro: "Section Chief Zama does?"
Shota: "He wants to see with his own eyes if my brain has turned pink."
Chihiro: "What is a pink brain?"
Shota: "If I've become an idiot because we're newlyweds."
Chihiro: "...Wow, that's intense."
Shota: "I think I can refuse, but..."
Chihiro: "He is welcome here."
Shota: "C-Can I really bring him?"
Chihiro: "I'll show off my cooking skills and do my best so that Sho-chan gets on his good side, even just a little."
Shota: "..."
Chihiro: "Oh, we're eating at home, right?"
Shota: "I think it'll probably turn out that way... more importantly, thank you, Chihiro..."
Chihiro: "...?"
Shota: "For always saving me."
Chihiro: "It is my natural duty as a wife."
...
*Squelch...*
Chihiro: "Nn..."
*Squelch, slip... slip...*
Chihiro: "Nn..."
Shota: "Ugh, ugh..."
Chihiro: "It came... out... didn't it."
Shota: "Y-Yeah."
Chihiro: "..."
As always.
Just before ejaculation, his penis was pulled out.
Sho-chan let his semen splatter onto my navel.
I toyed with it lovingly with my finger.
As usual, there was only a little bit.
If a lot came out, it would feel even better.
That's why I tried various things with food and such.
But it doesn't change much.
He wasn't a person with a strong sex drive to begin with...
Shota: "...Sorry for being so quick."
Chihiro: "Not at all."
I shook my head desperately.
Chihiro: "It was really good."
Shota: "I-It felt good for me too."
Chihiro: "...Shall we go to sleep soon?"
Shota: "Yeah..."
We turned down the lights and slipped into the futon.
As always, I had Sho-chan hold me.
He's thin, but to me, his chest is worth relying on.
I really am happy.
When we're like this, I fall asleep right away...

Yusaku: "..."
Yusaku: "Good grief, are you a moron?"
Don't zoom in on the coupling when he's creampieing her.
The whole screen is nothing but mosaics, isn't it?
Fix the camera on the actress's face twisted in agony here.
What's the point if the guy filming gets excited?
Idiot.
Die.
If you don't want to die, let me hold the camera.
You're so shitty at this, it makes my dick go soft.
Yusaku: "Hmph..."
I let go of my half-erect penis and gulped down the rest of my beer.
Lukewarm and gross.
Piece of shit.
The snack is Sea Chicken.
And it's the one I opened yesterday.
Even though it's summer, I eat well.
A stomach as tough as my cock.
That's why I haven't put anything decent in my belly tonight either.
Well, whatever.
Tomorrow is dinner at the idiot Akizuki's house.
Looks like I'll finally get some decent grub after a long time.
I don't know what kind of woman he married.
But judging by his bento, her cooking skills are OK.
So even if her looks are dirty and plain, I'll tolerate it.
Knowing that useless guy...
She's bound to be an ugly broad whose only redeeming quality is her youth.
