...The next day, 8:00 PM...
Yusaku: "You live in a pretty nice place."
Shota: "I'm humbled you think so."
Yusaku: "...What floor?"
Shota: "Ah, Room 303..."
Yusaku: "I asked what floor."
Shota: "Th-Third floor."
Yusaku: "So, are you telling me to push the elevator button?"
Shota: "Gh, I'm sorry."
...
*Ding... Hiss...*
Yusaku: "Huh..."
Getting off the elevator, the view suddenly opened up.
It was a quiet residential area.
Maybe because the first floor was shops, the courtyard was a large parking lot.
Yusaku: "Hurry up and ring the chime."
Shota: "Y-Yes."
*Ding-dong.*
Chihiro: "Coming."
Yusaku: "..."
Alright, bring out the cooking-expert ugly broad.
This might be horror show levels of bad.
Chihiro: "Welcome."
Yusaku: "..."
I was speechless.
To put it bluntly, I was surprised.
No, surprised doesn't even begin to cover it.
Big, distinct features.
If anything, she's on par with some famous female announcer.
Chihiro: "Thank you for always taking care of my husband."
The woman bowed politely.
Suddenly, a view of her cleavage peeked out.
And her tits are huge to boot.
Yusaku: "Ma'am, I apologize for visiting at such an hour."
Chihiro: "Not at all."
Yusaku: "..."
Give me a break.
Now she hits me with an angelic smile.
Chihiro: "Thank you so much for coming today. I'll have the meal ready shortly, so please make yourself comfortable until then."
She bowed again, showing off that cleavage once more.
Then, with the light sound of slippers...
She padded away into the back of the room.
Every gesture was absolutely perfect.
And yet, I felt a strange clumsiness in it too.
What is this sense of incongruity?
Is she just scared because I'm the boss?
Shota: "W-Well then, Section Chief... would you like a beer first...?"
Yusaku: "...Oi."
Shota: "Y-Yes."
Yusaku: "How did you trick her?"
Shota: "Huh?"
Yusaku: "I'm talking about your beautiful wife."
Shota: "T-Trick her? No, that's... that makes me sound terrible..."
Yusaku: "Hmph..."
Whatever.
I marched right into the room.
A clean living room where cleaning had reached every corner.
Two beers, fresh from the fridge, sat on the table.
Hors d'oeuvres were lined up with a stylish flair.
Good grief.
It makes my skin crawl.
A warm family welcoming the boss without a single flaw.
I want to destroy it right now.
Besides, I'm hungry.
Stop trying to look cool and just bring out a rice bowl or something.
...
Yusaku: "..."
About twenty minutes into the meal.
As you can see, the conversation isn't exactly lively.
The only time I offered a topic was right after picking up my chopsticks.
That this year's heat is rare to see.
That maybe because of it, there's an abnormal number of cicadas.
Aside from that, I ignored the two restless people...
And devoted myself entirely to eating.
Shota: "Gh..."
Chihiro: "Um..."
The wife looked at my face with reservation.
Why am I sitting directly opposite her?
Because food doesn't taste good while looking at a bastard's face.
So I took the liberty of moving seats.
Just that was enough to make the timid husband shrink, wondering if he'd committed some blunder.
And the wife was just bewildered, not knowing the reason.
Chihiro: "...Does it suit your palate?"
Yusaku: "..."
It doesn't suit me
You are a skilled cook, ma'am
Yusaku: "It doesn't suit me."
Chihiro: "Gh..."
Shota: "Ah, no... um..."
Chihiro: "I-I'm sorry. I will study your preferences before you come next time, Section Chief."
Yusaku: "..."
Surprised by the unexpected response?
Truth is, it's so good my cheeks are about to melt.
I just felt like being a little mean.
As far as the eye can see, it's nothing but time-consuming dishes.
She probably started prepping this morning.
A young wife devoted to her husband, huh?
Well, you'd best do your utmost until I leave.
Yusaku: "You are a skilled cook, ma'am."
Chihiro: "Oh, thank you very much."
Shota: "Section Chief, please eat as much as you like."
Yusaku: "judging by this, you must be skilled at other things too, right?"
Chihiro: "Eh?"
Shota: "???"
Yusaku: "I'm talking about *that*, aside from cooking. *That*."
Chihiro: "Th-That?"
Shota: "Gh..."
Yusaku: "(Hmph...)"
What are they thinking?
The couple is looking at each other.
Yusaku: "Like cleaning and laundry, for example."
Chihiro: "Oh... N-No, I wouldn't say I'm skilled... not particularly."
Yusaku: "But you seem like you're good with handling procedures."
Chihiro: "It's just that I've always liked cooking, ever since a long time ago."
Yusaku: "Then, do you like thick daikon?"
Chihiro: "D-Daikon?"
Yusaku: "Not just regular daikon, I mean the really thick ones."
Chihiro: "...Thick... daikon."
Shota: "..."
Looking at each other again.
The wife is one thing, but Akizuki...
Don't you join in and get confused too.
This level of harassment is a daily occurrence at the office.
It's not like you just met me yesterday.
Chihiro: "...I often use them for miso soup, though."
Yusaku: "The thick ones?"
Chihiro: "I-In my own way."
Yusaku: "What about thick cucumbers?"
Shota: "I-I like them pickled."
Yusaku: "...I was asking your wife."
Shota: "S-Sorry."
Chihiro: "Gh... It's my fault for not answering right away... I'm sorry..."
Yusaku: "..."
Husband and wife love so lukewarm the food's about to rot.
A husband protecting his cute new wife.
A young wife trying to cover for that husband.
I don't like it.
Are you saying the fun dinner will be ruined otherwise?
Yusaku: "By the way..."
Shota & Chihiro: "Y-Yes."
How did you two meet?
You got married about six months ago?
Any plans for kids?
Yusaku: "How did you two meet?"
Chihiro: "Umm..."
Looking at each other yet again.
They're deferring to one another on who should answer.
Yusaku: "Please, let the wife answer the juicy story."
Chihiro: "Ah, yes... well..."
She nodded and cleared her throat delicately.
Her refined mouth is cute.
They say if you turn lips vertical, they become the shape of genitals...
Do you have a pussy like that too, ma'am?
Chihiro: "My husband and I were classmates until middle school."
Yusaku: "Huh..."
Chihiro: "Our houses were pretty close, too... right, honey?"
Shota: "Y-Yeah."
Yusaku: "That alone wouldn't lead to marriage, surely."
Chihiro: "R-Right... When I happened to go back home to visit, my husband just happened to be at his parents' house... this was about five years ago now."
Yusaku: "So you reunited by chance there."
Chihiro: "Until I went to university in Tokyo, we'd see each other in town occasionally. But by then, we were just exchanging standard greetings..."
Yusaku: "Wait, wasn't Akizuki at a university in Tokyo too?"
Shota: "I-I'm one year younger. So Chihiro went to Tokyo a year before me."
Chihiro: "Even though we were both in Tokyo, I didn't know where he lived. And we weren't close enough back then to exchange contact info..."
Yusaku: "I see, I see."
In other words, an older wife.
Akizuki is 24, if I recall.
That means this woman is 25.
Ten years younger than me?
Plus, maybe because her features are youthful, she doesn't look her age at all.
She could probably pass for barely over twenty.
Yusaku: "Akizukiiiii."
Shota: "Y-Yes."
Yusaku: "How did you seduce such a beautiful wife?"
Shota: "N-No, um..."
Yusaku: "Speak honestly."
Chihiro: "A-Actually, it was me who..."
Yusaku: "Hah?"
The young wife's cheeks turned a faint cherry blossom pink.
She's seriously blushing.
Chihiro: "I-I invited my husband to the summer festival when he came back home. Even though four years had passed since I went to Tokyo, Sho-chan hadn't become sophisticated at all..."
Sho-chan.
At that word, she hurriedly covered her mouth.
Chihiro: "Ah, I'm sorry."
Yusaku: "Sho-chan is fine... right, Sho-chan from City Hall?"
Shota: "...P-Please spare me, Section Chief."
Chihiro: "A-Anyway, I was moved by my husband's simplicity. He wasn't poisoned by his surroundings, he wasn't trying to act bigger than he was... I thought, 'Wow, there are still men like this nowadays'..."
Yusaku: "..."
A "how we met" story straight out of a painting.
I like it less and less.
Makes me want to hop in a time machine and smash it to pieces.
Yusaku: "So you started dating, and it led to marriage... is that it?"
Chihiro: "Yes, if you trace it back to the source, the chance reunion was the trigger."
Yusaku: "What else?"
Chihiro: "Eh?"
Yusaku: "The reason for marriage aside from simplicity."
Chihiro: "H-His kindness, and various other things..."
Yusaku: "What about the magnificence of his tool?"
Chihiro: "...Tool?"
Shota: "S-Section Chief."
Yusaku: "...What."
Shota: "Ah, no... talk of that sort is a bit..."
Yusaku: "It's night time, isn't it? Who cares."
Shota: "I-I don't think that's the issue."
Yusaku: "..."
Hmmm.
For the timid Akizuki, he's trying awfully hard.
I see.
He can't stand his precious wife being teased?
So you're head over heels for her too, not losing to your wife in that department.
Fine.
Out of consideration for your desperate face, Akizuki, with the tiny willy I saw on the company trip... I'll end this topic.
Yusaku: "By the way, ma'am..."
Chihiro: "Y-Yes."
Yusaku: "While I'm asking, ma'am."
Chihiro: "Y-Yes."
Yusaku: "You got married about six months ago?"
Shota: "N-No, a year and... a bit..."
Yusaku: "Oh? Has it been that long already?"
Shota: "The ceremony was last June..."
Yusaku: "I wasn't invited, so I forgot."
Shota: "Gh..."
The two looked at each other, troubled.
Suddenly the food's hard to swallow, isn't it?
Shota: "We went back to the countryside and had the ceremony with just family... I think I told you before..."
Yusaku: "But surely you came back here and had a reception."
Shota: "N-Not a reception, we just invited friends..."
Yusaku: "Was that right, ma'am?"
Chihiro: "...Eh?"
Surprised to have the conversation suddenly thrown at her.
It's not that she was zoning out.
She was so worried about her husband being attacked that her awareness of me went on vacation.
She likes this guy that much.
With looks like that, she could have had her pick of men.
Why Akizuki, huh?
Yusaku: "Just an unveiling with friends?"
Chihiro: "Y-Yes."
Yusaku: "Well, can't be helped then. Right, Akizuki-kun?"
Shota: "Gh..."
Yusaku: "By the way, ma'am..."
Chihiro: "Y-Yes."
Yusaku: "While I'm asking, ma'am."
Chihiro: "Y-Yes."
Yusaku: "Any plans for kids?"
Shota: "S-Section Chief."
Yusaku: "Nowadays even men take paternity leave, you know. As a boss, I need to know, even vaguely."
Shota: "She is a housewife... so I won't be taking paternity leave."
Yusaku: "...Do you hate being asked that much?"
Shota: "Ah, no... but..."
Chihiro: "There are no plans for the time being."
Shota: "..."
The woman looked at my face and smiled.
A lifeboat at the perfect timing.
She sensitively sensed the atmosphere turning bad.
She's pretty quick-witted, isn't she?
Compared to that, the inflexible husband...
To put it clearly, he's losing to his wife.
Yusaku: "By the way, ma'am..."
Chihiro: "Y-Yes."
Yusaku: "While I'm asking, ma'am."
Chihiro: "Y-Yes."
Yusaku: "Phew..."
I drained the beer remaining in my glass.
Exactly one hour since sitting down.
Even with the AC on, it's already turned lukewarm.
What surprised me was what happened next.
The woman didn't miss my slightly dissatisfied expression.
Chihiro: "I'm sorry I didn't notice. I'll bring you a new beer."
Saying that, the woman left her seat.
The husband left behind.
He's desperate to bridge the silence somehow.
You don't have to say anything.
You can only make boring conversation anyway.
Yusaku: "Don't trouble yourself."
Using those words as an excuse, I observed the young wife's ass.
Quite plump, a nice ass.
Despite that, the curve of her slim waist is seductive.
Oi, oi.
I can't believe it more and more.
This idiot embraces such a fine woman every night?
Pearls before swine.
Gold coins to a cat.
Endless phrases of ridicule float to mind.
Chihiro: "...Thank you for waiting."
Yusaku: "This will be the last one."
Chihiro: "Please, stay and relax a while longer."
Yusaku: "..."
Of course, I'm not taking that seriously.
Standard social pleasantries towards a husband's boss.
Yusaku: "We have work tomorrow, after all."
I poured the cold beer down my throat in one go.
After that, it was idle chatter.
I stopped spewing so much poison, too.
Why, you ask?
Because I've become interested, in various ways.
Sarcastic words are meaningless now.
That's right.
I'm planning to take home a souvenir better than that.
...
Chihiro: "..."
Chihiro: "...Phew."
Just a little sigh.
The dinner is finally over.
I'm starting to clean up in the kitchen.
My husband is slumped over on the table.
Limp and unmoving.
He might have fallen asleep.
But I can't cut the thread of tension yet.
Because the Section Chief is in the washroom.
Before leaving, he offered that he wanted to sober up.
Apparently, washing his face makes him feel refreshed.
Chihiro: "...Phew."
Just one more small sigh.
I probably won't be able to forget tonight's events for a while.
I didn't think he would be that strange of a person.
I feel like I caught a glimpse of my husband's hardships.
He's probably not a bad person, but...
To put it nicely, he's eccentric.
To put it badly, he lacks common sense.
His eyes are sharp, too.
It feels like he wouldn't forgive mistakes even outside of work.
He seems strict about hierarchy too.
So I have to be careful.
Mid-year gifts, year-end gifts, New Year's cards.
I'll support my husband firmly by sending them without fail.
That's about all I can do.
Yusaku: "Ma'am."
Chihiro: "...?"
The Section Chief's voice from the other side of the door.
It made my heart jump.
Chihiro: "Y-Yes."
Yusaku: "Could you lend me a largish towel?"
Chihiro: "...Is something the matter?"
Yusaku: "I got my trousers wet when washing my face."
Chihiro: "P-Please use the bath towels on the shelf."
Yusaku: "...Which shelf would that be?"
Chihiro: "The single-door cabinet next to the vanity..."
I stopped speaking halfway through.
Oh no.
There are various things in there.
I think even my stash of sanitary products.
Chihiro: "W-Wait a moment, please."
Quite flustered.
I trotted to the washroom.
Chihiro: "!?"
Yusaku: "Oh my."
Chihiro: "Ah... ah..."
Yusaku: "Please knock at least, ma'am."
Chihiro: "I-I'm sorry!"
*Bam!!*
Chihiro: "Haa... haa..."
My heart feels like it's going to come out of my mouth.
What was that?
Why did he have his underwear down too?
His penis hanging limply.
It was so big it felt grotesque.
Chihiro: "Gh..."
I feel so nauseous I might vomit.
I glance toward the table.
My husband is still slumped over.
He hasn't noticed anything that happened.
Yusaku: "..."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
Yusaku: "...Excuse me."
Chihiro: "N-No, I should be the one... I'm sorry..."
Yusaku: "I ended up getting even my underwear soaking wet. Since you opened it without any warning, I wasn't able to deal with it either."
Chihiro: "Gh... I'm truly sorry."
I feel like shrinking away at his overly polite language.
I'm still flustered.
All I can do is apologize; not a single clever word comes to mind.
Yusaku: "Well, it was unavoidable force. Let's both forget about it."
As he said that, the Section Chief's gaze went to my husband.
Yusaku: "...Did you see it?"
Chihiro: "Eh?"
Yusaku: "My willy."
Chihiro: "Gh..."
What kind of thing is he asking?
It's hopeless.
I just looked down, my face red.
I even start to feel like he's being mean on purpose.
Yusaku: "Akizuki-kun is out cold, isn't he."
Chihiro: "I-I don't think he drank that much... he isn't strong with alcohol to begin with..."
Yusaku: "Please tell him not to be late tomorrow."
Chihiro: "Ah..."
No.
I have to see him out properly.
Chihiro: "I-I'll wake my husband."
Yusaku: "Let's leave him be."
Chihiro: "I'll get scolded later."
Yusaku: "Please, get scolded all you want."
Chihiro: "Gh..."
Yusaku: "Well then, ma'am, thank you for the meal."
Chihiro: "I-I wasn't able to offer you much hospitality..."
Yusaku: "Not at all."
The Section Chief stared at my face.
For some reason, eyes like a snake.
I responded desperately with a fake smile.
If I avert my gaze here, it'll make the impression even worse.
Yusaku: "...Good night."
Chihiro: "G-Good night. Please be careful on your way."
*...Click... Thud...*
Chihiro: "..."
I collapsed into a sit right there.
I have no strength in my body.
Sho-chan.
I did my best, in my own way.
So hug me later.
Hug me lots and lots.
...
